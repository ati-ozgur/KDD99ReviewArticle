  abstract = {Detecting concept drifts and reducing the impact from the noise in real applications of data streams are challenging but valuable for inductive learning. It is especially a challenge in a light demand on the overheads of time and space. However, though a great number of inductive learning algorithms based on ensemble classification models have been proposed for handling concept drifting data streams, little attention has been focused on the detection of the diversity of concept drifts and the influence from noise in data streams simultaneously. Motivated by this, we present a new light-weighted inductive algorithm for concept drifting detection in virtue of an ensemble model of random decision trees (named CDRDT) to distinguish various types of concept drifts from noisy data streams in this article. We use variably small data chunks to generate random decision trees incrementally. Meanwhile, we introduce the inequality of Hoeffding bounds and the principle of statistical quality control to detect the different types of concept drifts and noise. Extensive studies on synthetic and real streaming data demonstrate that CDRDT could effectively and efficiently detect concept drifts from the noisy streaming data. Therefore, our algorithm provides a feasible reference framework of classification for concept drifting data streams with noise.},

There is no clear description as to what packets can be considered normal or abnormal. If the invasions are not detected at the appropriate level, the loss to system may be some times unimaginable. Although many intrusion detection system (IDS) methods are used to detect the existing types of attacks within the network infrastructures, reducing false negative and false positives is still a major issue. In our paper an intrusion detection system is designed to classify by the incorporation of enhanced rules as learnt from the network behavior with less computational complexity of O(n). The method demonstrates the achievements of promising classification rate. The bench mark data KDD99 data is used in our method.},

In the proposed model, a multi-layer \{SVM\} classifier is adopted to estimate whether the action is an attack, \{KPCA\} is used as a preprocessor of \{SVM\} to reduce the dimension of feature vectors and shorten training time. In order to reduce the noise caused by feature differences and improve the performance of SVM, an improved kernel function (N-RBF) is proposed by embedding the mean value and the mean square difference values of feature attributes in \{RBF\} kernel function. \{GA\} is employed to optimize the punishment factor C, kernel parameters œÉ and the tube size …õ of SVM. By comparison with other detection algorithms, the experimental results show that the proposed model performs higher predictive accuracy, faster convergence speed and better generalization. },

  abstract = {Abstract The main aim in network anomaly detection is effectively spotting hostile events within the traffic pattern associated to network operations, by distinguishing them from normal activities. This can be only accomplished by acquiring the a-priori knowledge about any kind of hostile behavior that can potentially affect the network (that is quite impossible for practical reasons) or, more easily, by building a model that is general enough to describe the normal network behavior and detect the violations from it. Earlier detection frameworks were only able to distinguish already known phenomena within traffic data by using pre-trained models based on matching specific events on pre-classified chains of traffic patterns. Alternatively, more recent statistics-based approaches were able to detect outliers respect to a statistic idealization of normal network behavior. Clearly, while the former approach is not able to detect previously unknown phenomena (zero-day attacks) the latter one has limited effectiveness since it cannot be aware of anomalous behaviors that do not generate significant changes in traffic volumes. Machine learning allows the development of adaptive, non-parametric detection strategies that are based on ‚Äúunderstanding‚Äù the network dynamics by acquiring through a proper training phase a more precise knowledge about normal or anomalous phenomena in order to classify and handle in a more effective way any kind of behavior that can be observed on the network. Accordingly, we present a new anomaly detection strategy based on supervised machine learning, and more precisely on a batch relevance-based fuzzyfied learning algorithm, known as U-BRAIN, aiming at understanding through inductive inference the specific laws and rules governing normal or abnormal network traffic, in order to reliably model its operating dynamics. The inferred rules can be applied in real time on online network traffic. This proposal appears to be promising both in terms of identification accuracy and robustness/flexibility when coping with uncertainty in the detection/classification process, as verified through extensive evaluation experiments. },

  abstract = {Abstract Security threats against computer networks and the Internet have emerged as a major and increasing area of concern for end-users trying to protect their valuable information and resources from intrusive attacks. Due to the amount of data to be analysed and the similarities between attack and normal traffic patterns, intrusion detection is considered a complex real world problem. In this paper, we propose a solution that uses a genetic algorithm to evolve a set of simple, interval-based rules based on statistical, continuous-valued input data. Several innovations in the genetic algorithm work to keep the ruleset small. We first tune the proposed system using a synthetic data. We then evaluate our system against more complex synthetic data with characteristics associated with network intrusions, the NSL-KDD benchmark dataset, and another dataset constructed based on \{MIT\} Lincoln Laboratory normal traffic and the low-rate \{DDoS\} attack scenario from CAIDA. This new approach provides a very compact set of simple, human-readable rules with strongly competitive detection performance in comparison to other machine learning techniques. },

  abstract = {Abstract In machine learning, a combination of classifiers, known as an ensemble classifier, often outperforms individual ones. While many ensemble approaches exist, it remains, however, a difficult task to find a suitable ensemble configuration for a particular dataset. This paper proposes a novel ensemble construction method that uses \{PSO\} generated weights to create ensemble of classifiers with better accuracy for intrusion detection. Local unimodal sampling (LUS) method is used as a meta-optimizer to find better behavioral parameters for PSO. For our empirical study, we took five random subsets from the well-known \{KDD99\} dataset. Ensemble classifiers are created using the new approaches as well as the weighted majority algorithm (WMA) approach. Our experimental results suggest that the new approach can generate ensembles that outperform \{WMA\} in terms of classification accuracy. },

An IDS is responsible to alert the network, in case of any threat observation. This paper broadens the scope of IDS by considering intrusion response also. The proposed work is organized into several phases such as feature selection, trust degree computation, classification and decision making. Intelligent agents are employed to handle all the aforementioned phases. Features of KDD Cup '99 are reduced from 41 to 17 to minimize the training time and to improve the accuracy of the system. Feature selection is achieved by information gain ratio. The trust degree is computed by the combination of packet delivery ratio, behavior and available energy of a node. The trust degree parameters are vital elements in the classification and the decision-making phase. Extreme learning machine (ELM) is employed as the classifier to categorize nodes into trustworthy, partially trustworthy and malicious. The performance of the system is evaluated in different scenarios such as with/without feature selection and with/without trust degree computation, with respect to detection accuracy, misclassification rate and detection time. The classification accuracy of SVM, MLP, ELM and ELM with trust is also compared.},

  abstract = {Learning by an exchange of knowledge and experiences enables humans to act efficiently in a very dynamic environment. Thus, it would be highly desirable to enable intelligent distributed systems to behave in a way which follows that biological archetype. We believe that knowledge exchange will become increasingly important in many application areas such as intrusion detection, driver assistance, or robotics. Constituents of a distributed system such as software agents, cars equipped with smart sensors, or intelligent robots may learn from each other by exchanging knowledge in form of classification rules, for instance. This article proposes techniques for the exchange of classification rules that represent uncertain knowledge. For that purpose, we introduce methods for knowledge acquisition in dynamic environments, for gathering and using meta-knowledge about rules (i.e., experience), and for rule exchange in distributed systems. The methods are based on a probabilistic knowledge modeling approach. We describe the results of two case studies where we show that knowledge exchange (exchange of learned rules) may be superior to information exchange (exchange of raw observations, i.e. samples) and demonstrate that the use of experiences (meta-knowledge concerning the rules) may improve that rule exchange process further. Some possible real application scenarios are sketched briefly and an application in the field of intrusion detection in computer networks is elaborated in more detail. },

At the end of the paper, we evaluate our method on a series of experiments on KDD Cup 1999 dataset.

In order to evaluate the performance of our proposed algorithm, comparisons with a feature set composed of all 41 features are carried out over the NSL-KDD data set using a multi-layer perceptron.},

In this paper, we propose a real-time intrusion detection approach using a supervised machine learning technique. Our approach is simple and efficient, and can be used with many machine learning techniques. We applied different well-known machine learning techniques to evaluate the performance of our IDS approach. Our experimental results show that the decision tree technique can outperform the other techniques. Therefore, we further developed a Real-Time Intrusion Detection System (RT-IDS) using the decision tree technique to classify on-line network data as normal or attack data. We also identified 12 essential features of network data which are relevant to detecting network attacks using the information gain as our feature selection criterions. Our RT-IDS can distinguish normal network activities from main attack types (Probe and Denial of Service (DoS)) with a detection rate higher than 98% within 2 seconds. We also developed a new post-processing procedure to reduce the false-alarm rate as well as increase the reliability and detection accuracy of the intrusion detection system.},

Therefore, we further developed the decision tree approach for our real-time intrusion detection system (RT-IDS), where the input network data is captured on-line in a real environment. In addition, we designed an optional post-processing procedure for our real-time intrusion detection system to reduce the false alarm rate of the intrusion detection and thus increase its reliability. We evaluated our IDS in terms of the detection speed, CPU usage, memory consumption, and detection accuracy


In the pre-processing phase which is shown in the upper part of Figure2, we use a packet sniffer, which is built with Jpcap library [28], 
DATASET Our experimental network data consists of four DoS attack types, 13 Probe attack types, and normal activity as presented in Table3. All attack types were generated using many different tools as shown in the table, while the normal network data was captured from the actual network environment. We captured online network data from the Computer Engineering Department at King Mongkut‚Äôs University of Technology Thonburi (KMUTT), Thailand. We call this dataset the RLD09 (Reliability Lab Data 2009) dataset. The dataset was captured during regular office hours for four days. The data consists of approximately ten million preprocessed data packets and contains a total of 17 attack types plus normal network activity as shown in Table 3. 
 The DoS attacks that we generated include Smurf, UDP flood, HTTP flood, and Jping. 
Tools for attacks generation

We have adopted well-known machine learning techniques which have been developed as free-ware tools in our classification approaches. We use the Weka tool version 3.6.0 [24] for our IDS development.

  abstract = {Abstract Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks pose a great threat to the data center, and many defense mechanisms have been proposed to detect it. On one hand, many services deployed in data center can easily lead to corresponding \{DDoS\} attacks. On the other hand, attackers constantly modify their tools to bypass these existing mechanisms, and researchers in turn modify their approaches to handle new attacks. Thus, the \{DDoS\} against data center is becoming more and more complex. In this paper, we first analyze the correlation information of flows in data center. Second, we present an effective detection approach based on \{CKNN\} (K-nearest neighbors traffic classification with correlation analysis) to detect \{DDoS\} attacks. The approach exploits correlation information of training data to improve the classification accuracy and reduce the overhead caused by the density of training data. Aiming at solving the huge cost, we also present a grid-based method named r-polling method for reducing training data involved in the calculation. Finally, we evaluate our approach with the Internet traffic and data center traffic trace. Compared with the traditional methods, our approach is good at detecting abnormal traffic with high efficiency, low cost and wide detection range. },

  abstract = {A \{DDoS\} attack is the most prevalent threat, viz., flooding the computing and communication resources in order to make the service unavailable for legitimate users, since a decade and continues to be threatening till date. Therefore, these critical resources must be protected against the \{DDoS\} attacks. The detection of \{DDoS\} attacks requires adaptive and incremental learning classifier, less computational complexity, and accurate decision making from uncertain information. Hence, the \{DDoS\} attacks could be detected using existing soft computing techniques such as fuzzy logic, neural networks, and genetic algorithms. Fuzzy logic has the advantage of interpreting the rules well but it suffers from the disadvantage of not able to acquire the rules automatically. The neural networks generalize the network well but they cannot interpret the rules. Genetic algorithm provides optimal solutions but the time complexity is high. Hybrid methods, Neuro-fuzzy and genetic fuzzy have been proposed to overcome the drawbacks of interpretability and manual rules acquisition. In this paper, adaptive and hybrid neuro-fuzzy systems were proposed as subsystems of the ensemble. Sugeno type Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) has been chosen as a base classifier for our research as Mamdani type \{ANFIS\} is not suitable for real time due to its high computational complexity and non-adaptiveness to extract exact knowledge from the dataset. Single classifier makes error on different training samples. So, by creating an ensemble of classifiers and combining their outputs, the total error can be reduced and the detection accuracy can be increased. Improvement in the performance of \{ANFIS\} ensemble is the focus of this paper. Our proposed \{DDoS\} classification algorithm, NFBoost, differs from the existing methods in weight update distribution strategy, error cost minimization, and ensemble output combination method, but resembles similar in classifier weight assignment and error computation. Our proposed \{NFBoost\} algorithm is achieved by combining ensemble of classifier outputs and Neyman Pearson cost minimization strategy, for final classification decision. Publicly available datasets such as \{KDD\} Cup, \{CAIDA\} \{DDOS\} Attack 2007, \{CONFICKER\} worm, \{UNINA\} traffic traces, and \{UCI\} Datasets were used for the simulation experiments. \{NFBoost\} was trained and tested with the publicly available datasets and our own \{SSE\} Lab1All hosts in \{SSE\} Lab are connected through a backbone bandwidth of 1 Gbps and to different sites through a 2 Mbps \{MPLS\} \{VPN\} cloud. 1 \{SSENET\} 2011 datasets. Detection accuracy and Cost per sample were the two metrics used to analyze the performance of the \{NFBoost\} classification algorithm and were compared with bagging, boosting, and AdaBoost algorithms. From the simulation results, it is evident that \{NFBoost\} algorithm achieves high detection accuracy (99.2%) with fewer false alarms. Cost per instance is also very less for the \{NFBoost\} algorithm compared to the existing algorithms. \{NFBoost\} algorithm outperforms the existing ensemble algorithms with a maximum gain of 8.4% and a minimum gain of 1.1%.},

  abstract = {The evaluation of unsupervised outlier detection algorithms is a constant challenge in data mining research. Little is known regarding the strengths and weaknesses of different standard outlier detection models, and the impact of parameter choices for these algorithms. The scarcity of appropriate benchmark datasets with ground truth annotation is a significant impediment to the evaluation of outlier methods. Even when labeled datasets are available, their suitability for the outlier detection task is typically unknown. Furthermore, the biases of commonly-used evaluation measures are not fully understood. It is thus difficult to ascertain the extent to which newly-proposed outlier detection methods improve over established methods. In this paper, we perform an extensive experimental study on the performance of a representative set of standard k nearest neighborhood-based methods for unsupervised outlier detection, across a wide variety of datasets prepared for this purpose. Based on the overall performance of the outlier detection methods, we provide a characterization of the datasets themselves, and discuss their suitability as outlier detection benchmark sets. We also examine the most commonly-used measures for comparing the performance of different methods, and suggest adaptations that are more suitable for the evaluation of outlier detection results.},

  abstract = {Clustering and classification models, or hybrid models are the most widely used models that can handle the diverse nature of NIDS dataset. Dirichlet process clustering technique is a non-parametric Bayesian mixture model that considers the data distribution of the dataset for the formation of distinct clusters. The number of clusters is not known a priori and it differs across different datasets. Determining the number of clusters based on the distribution of data instances can increase the performance of the model. Naive Bayes model, a supervised learning classification technique, maintains a better computational efficiency, by reducing the training time. In this paper, we propose a hybrid model to exploit the positive aspect of proper clustering of data instances and the computational efficiency in building a NIDS. RIPPER algorithm is used to extract rules from the traffic description for updation of the rule database. Experiments were conducted in the KDD CUP‚Äô99 and SSENet-2011 datasets to study the performance of the proposed model. Also, a comparison of three hybrid methods with the proposed hybrid model was carried out. The results showed that the proposed hybrid model is superior in building a robust perimeter security device.},

Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks targeting the cloud's bandwidth, services and resources to render the cloud unavailable to both cloud providers, and users are a common form of attacks. In recent times, feature selection has been identified as a pre-processing phase in cloud DDoS attack defence which can potentially increase classification accuracy and reduce computational complexity by identifying important features from the original dataset during supervised learning. In this work, we propose an ensemble-based multi-filter feature selection method that combines the output of four filter methods to achieve an optimum selection. We then perform an extensive experimental evaluation of our proposed method using intrusion detection benchmark dataset, NSL-KDD and decision tree classifier. The findings show that our proposed method can effectively reduce the number of features from 41 to 13 and has a high detection rate and classification accuracy when compared to other classification techniques.},

Similar advances in the field of intelligent computing have led to the introduction of several classification techniques for accurately identifying and differentiating network traffic into normal and anomalous. Group Method for Data Handling (GMDH) is one such supervised inductive learning approach for the synthesis of neural network models. Through this paper, we propose a GMDH-based technique for classifying network traffic into normal and anomalous. Two variants of the technique, namely, Monolithic and Ensemble-based, were tested on the KDD-99 dataset. The dataset was preprocessed and all features were ranked based on three feature ranking techniques, namely, Information Gain, Gain Ratio, and \{GMDH\} by itself. The results obtained proved that the proposed intrusion detection scheme yields high attack detection rates, nearly 98%, when compared with other intelligent classification techniques for network intrusion detection. },

  abstract = {Intrusion detection systems that make use of artificial intelligence techniques in order to improve effectiveness have been actively pursued in the last decade. However, their complexity to learn new attacks has become very expensive, making them inviable for a real time retraining. In order to overcome such limitations, we have introduced a new pattern recognition technique called optimum-path forest (OPF) to this task. Our proposal is composed of three main contributions: to apply \{OPF\} for intrusion detection, to identify redundancy in some public datasets and also to perform feature selection over them. The experiments have been carried out on three datasets aiming to compare \{OPF\} against Support Vector Machines, Self Organizing Maps and a Bayesian classifier. We have showed that \{OPF\} has been the fastest classifier and the always one with the top results. Thus, it can be a suitable tool to detect intrusions on computer networks, as well as to allow the algorithm to learn new attacks faster than other techniques.},

The \{AIS\} paradigms are negative selection, clonal selection, danger theory, and immune network. These paradigms are very successful for anomaly IDS. The \{AIS\} paradigms are inspired by the powerful human immune system (HIS) and are promising candidate for design of an IDS. The proposed AIS-based agents are capable of learning, self-adaption, platform mobility, autonomy and collaboration. The proposed system (MAIS-IDS) was designed using these powerful and collaborative agents. This system has mobile and static agents with detector agents as the main actors in MAIS-IDS. The life cycles of agents are determined using the proposed immune algorithms in specific phases. Essential characteristics of MAIS-IDS are cloning, mutation, migration, collaboration, and randomness. MAIS-IDS was evaluated using a network of virtualized hosts, a kernel-based virtual machine (KVM) hypervisor and management Orchestra. },

The novelty of this research is in its combining of the three above mentioned approaches to develop a new classifier which can be applied to detect network intrusion, with incremental learning capability, by adapting the weight of key features. In addition, four mechanisms: creating a new antibody using PBIL, dynamic adjustment of feature weighting using clonal expansion, antibody hierarchy adjustment using mean affinity, as well as usage rates, are proposed to intensify \{AIS\} performance. As shown by the comparison carried out with other artificial intelligence and evolutionary computation approaches in network anomaly detection problems, our PBIL-AISCF classifier can achieve high accuracy for the benchmark problem. },

Data Preprocessing olarak g√ºzel bir makale bence There are two main approaches for dealing with classification problems that involve more than two classes. One tries to transform the multiple class problem in several binary problems, while the other deals directly with the multiple class problem. This last strategy can present overtraining for those classes that are easily separable or those classes that are the majority in the dataset, i.e. those classes with a much higher number of representative samples than the other classes (Forman, 2003). However, the first strategy also presents some drawbacks, such as how to integrate the information that comes from each of the binary classifiers, or the fact that there may not exist enough representation of a specific class in the training set generated from the original one to train the binary classifier. Feature selection is primarily performed to select relevant and informative features, but it can have other motivations, including general data reduction, feature set reduction, performance improvement and better data understanding. There are two main models dealing with feature selection: filter methods and wrapper methods (Kohavi and John, 1997). Wrapper models optimize a classifier as part of the selection process, while filter models rely on the general characteristics of the training data to select the best features with independence of any classifier. Wrapper methods use a classifier and a search technique to score subsets of features according to their predictive power. That is why they tend to obtain better performances than filters, even at the expense of a higher computational cost but, the filter model results in a better generalization because it acts independently of the induction algorithm. In the feature selection field, it is difficult to find methods that can deal directly with multiple class problems, as very little research has been done in this aspect The main difficulties to be taken into account in multiple class algorithms are the following: The dataset presents one or several classes that contain a considerable higher number of samples than the data of the other classes (unbalanced classes). Determining which features are appropriate for each class is complicated, because feature selection results in a set of attributes that could represent only the majority classes (Bosin et al., 2007). These characteristics convert this dataset in a challenge for the sake of classification. Moreover, there are some features with very unbalanced values (in both training and test sets) and even some of them are constantin the trainingset provided by the competition organizers. It will be shown that splitting the problem into several binary problems lead to better performance results and besides, features needed for each class are easily reflected. It has to be noticed that different subdivision techniques have been adopted (One vs Rest, One vs One) and also different strategies to unify the results obtained by the binary classifiers have been used. Besides, to prevent the problem of unbalanced classes, clearly represented in the KDD Cup dataset, an undersampling technique was employed, i.e. some samples for those classes with a high number of samples were discarded. Feature selection Feature selection consists of detecting the relevant features and discarding the irrelevant ones, with the goal of obtaining a subset of features that describes properly the given problem with a minimum degradation of performance. It has several advantages (Gu-yon et al., 2006), such as Improving the performance of the machine learning algorithms. Data understanding, gaining knowledge about the process and perhaps helping to visualize it. Data reduction, limiting storage requirements and perhaps helping in reducing costs. Simplicity, possibility of using simpler models and gaining speed. Several filter methods were tried to check whether the results obtained were different. Correlation-based Feature Selection (CFS) INTERACT (Zhao & Liu, 1991) and Consistency-based (Dash & Liu, 2003) filters were chosen for this study, with the aim of employing filters that use different performance measurements to select the final features. CFS is one of the most well-known and used filters, INTERACT is a new approach based in the interaction between features and finally, Consistency-based is a classical algorithm. Discretization In order to deal with numeric attributes, a common practice for those algorithms is to discretize the data before conducting feature selection. In addition to the many advantages of having discrete data over continuous one, a suite of classification learning algorithms can only deal with discrete data. Besides, the Weka tool (Witten and Frank, 2005) is used for the filtering process and it uses discretization by default. There exist many discretizators in the literature, but in this work the most suitable for large datasets have been chosen (Yang and Webb, 2002). In this manner, we choose EMD (Entropy Minimization Discretization), EWD (Equal Width Discretization) and EFD (Equal Frequency Discretization) because they are classic algorithms, and PKID because it is a new approach that works well with large datasets. Therefore, the proposed method, consisting of a combination of discretizator, filter and classifier, was applied first, for the sake of simplicity, to the binary case. Later, it will be applied to the multiple class case. The results obtained show that both discretizators and filters have a great influence in the results of the classifiers, as it can be seen in Bolon-Canedo et al. (2009). In fact, each combination of discretizator and filter leads to a different subset of features. Therefore, it was not possible to determine which combination was the best and several combinations were tested over the KDD Cup 99 binary dataset. Classifiers without symbolic conversion In this subsection, they will be discussed the results obtained with two classifiers that can deal with both numerical and symbolic attributes and no conversion is needed: C4.5 (Quinlan, 1993) and naive Bayes (Rish, 2001). Classifiers with symbolic conversion Three classifiers have been tested over the binary KDD Cup 99: one-layer Feedforward Neural Network (Castillo et al., 2002), Proximal Support Vector Machine (PSVM) (Mangasarian and Wild, 2001) and Multilayer Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) (Bishop, 1995). Therefore, a more used approach is the one based on multiple binary classifiers. This approach consists of employing class binarization techniques which reduce the multiple class problem into a series of binary problems which are solved individually. Then, the resultant predictions are combined to obtain a final solution One vs Rest The most popular class binarization technique is the One vs Rest class binarization, where one takes each class in turn and learns binary concepts that discriminate that class from all other classes. This technique transforms a c-class problem into c two-class problems. One vs One This class binarization technique consists of learning one classifier for each pair of classes. The One vs One class binarization transforms a c-class problem into c (c-1)/2 two-class problems, one for each set of classes {i,j}. Decoding techniques However, in some cases, a given test sample may not be assigned to any of those classes, because the classifier was not trained with them (consider for example a pattern of class 3 or 4 in the first classifier (first row) in Fig. 4). Therefore, there are three possible outputs: positive (+1), negative (?1) or ignored (0). Then, to assign a pattern to the positive or negative classes, their corresponding probability must be higher than a determined threshold (p > r), otherwise the considered output is ignored. Hamming decoding Loss-based decoding Accumulative sum Probability accumulative sum Experimental setup for multiple classes Owing to the unbalance of the KDD Cup 99 training dataset (see Table 1), other training subsets have been employed to solve this drawback. Depending on the classification technique chosen (multiple class algorithm, One vs One or One vs Rest), different training datasets were constructed. It is important to remind that although several training sets were employed, the test dataset did not change and then it was the same used in the KDD Cup 99 Competition, in order to make fair comparisons. Basically, these new training datasets were obtained after applying the undersampling technique (explained below) over the KDD Cup 99 training dataset that contains 494,021 samples. Besides, a reduced training set is also employed, which is a widely used option by the authors of the literature (Alonso-Betanzos et al., 2007; Fugate and Gattiker, 2003). This reduced set contains 46,093 instances and maintains the proportions of the original dataset. Thus it is also unbalanced and the undersampling technique is still required. Undersampling So it is essential to give more weight to the classes with fewer samples: Probe, R2L and specially U2R. In fact, in all the works reported by other authors , those are the classes with the worst classification rate. Different techniques can be adopted to solve this problem namely oversampling, undersampling and cost-modifying. In this case, considering the number of samples available, an undersampling technique was chosen that consists of eliminating, at random, elements of the over-sized class until it matches the size of the other classes. Several ratios between minority and majority classes were taken into account leading to different training datasets, but in any case the test dataset was modified. This paper proposes a method based on the combination of discretization, filtering and classification methods that maintains the performance results of the classifiers but using a reduced set of features. Specifically, it has been applied over the KDD Cup 99 dataset, a benchmark in the intrusion detection field. This method improves the results obtained by the KDD Cup 99 Competition winner and also by other authors with a significant reduction in the number of features used in two different approaches. The simplest one considers a binary classification and the second one a multiple class classification

OneR is utilized as horizontal compression for attribute reduction, and affinity propagation is employed as vertical compression to select small representative exemplars from large training data. As to be able to computationally compress the larger volume of training data with scalability, MapReduce based parallelization approach is then implemented and evaluated for each step of the model compression process abovementioned, on which common but efficient classification methods can be directly used. Experimental application study on two publicly available datasets of intrusion detection, \{KDD99\} and CMDC2012, demonstrates that the classification using the compressed model proposed can effectively speed up the detection procedure at up to 184 times, most importantly at the cost of a minimal accuracy difference with less than 1% on average. },

Review:
KDD99LargeClaim In fact, the running of AP is finally halted out of memory when the items are larger than 5,000 for the iterative computation on data matrix (Note that AP clustering definitely runs out of memory for 6000 training data instances in Fig. 4.). Therefore, the general PC cannot at all afford the computation burden of AP clustering for large training dataset such as KDD99.

Because \{IDSs\} deal with a large amount of data, one of the crucial tasks of \{IDSs\} is to keep the best quality of features that represent the whole data and remove the redundant and irrelevant features. The proposed model uses the cuttlefish algorithm (CFA) as a search strategy to ascertain the optimal subset of features and the decision tree (DT) classifier as a judgement on the selected features that are produced by the CFA. The \{KDD\} Cup 99 dataset is used to evaluate the proposed model. The results show that the feature subset obtained by using \{CFA\} gives a higher detection rate and accuracy rate with a lower false alarm rate, when compared with the obtained results using all features.},

  abstract = {Abstract Security policies of information systems and networks are designed for maintaining the integrity of both the confidentiality and availability of the data for their trusted users. However, a number of malicious users analyze the vulnerabilities of these systems in order to gain unauthorized access or to compromise the quality of service. For this reason, Intrusion Detection Systems have been designed in order to monitor the system and trigger alerts whenever they found a suspicious event. Optimal Intrusion Detection Systems are those that achieve a high attack detection rate together with a small number of false alarms. However, cyber attacks present many different characteristics which make them hard to be properly identified by simple statistical methods. According to this fact, Data Mining techniques, and especially those based in Computational Intelligence, have been used for implementing robust and accuracy Intrusion Detection Systems. In this paper, we consider the use of Genetic Fuzzy Systems within a pairwise learning framework for the development of such a system. The advantages of using this approach are twofold: first, the use of fuzzy sets, and especially linguistic labels, enables a smoother borderline between the concepts, and allows a higher interpretability of the rule set. Second, the divide-and-conquer learning scheme, in which we contrast all possible pair of classes with aims, improves the precision for the rare attack events, as it obtains a better separability between a ‚Äúnormal activity‚Äù and the different attack types. The goodness of our methodology is supported by means of a complete experimental study, in which we contrast the quality of our results versus the state-of-the-art of Genetic Fuzzy Systems for intrusion detection and the C4.5 decision tree. },

  abstract = {Abstract It is challenging to use traditional data mining techniques to deal with real-time data stream classifications. Existing mining classifiers need to be updated frequently to adapt to the changes in data streams. To address this issue, in this paper we propose an adaptive ensemble approach for classification and novel class detection in concept drifting data streams. The proposed approach uses traditional mining classifiers and updates the ensemble model automatically so that it represents the most recent concepts in data streams. For novel class detection we consider the idea that data points belonging to the same class should be closer to each other and should be far apart from the data points belonging to other classes. If a data point is well separated from the existing data clusters, it is identified as a novel class instance. We tested the performance of this proposed stream classification model against that of existing mining algorithms using real benchmark datasets from \{UCI\} (University of California, Irvine) machine learning repository. The experimental results prove that our approach shows great flexibility and robustness in novel class detection in concept drifting and outperforms traditional classification models in challenging real-life data stream applications. },

  abstract = {Abstract In this paper, we introduce two independent hybrid mining algorithms to improve the classification accuracy rates of decision tree (DT) and na√Øve Bayes (NB) classifiers for the classification of multi-class problems. Both \{DT\} and \{NB\} classifiers are useful, efficient and commonly used for solving classification problems in data mining. Since the presence of noisy contradictory instances in the training set may cause the generated decision tree suffers from overfitting and its accuracy may decrease, in our first proposed hybrid \{DT\} algorithm, we employ a na√Øve Bayes (NB) classifier to remove the noisy troublesome instances from the training set before the \{DT\} induction. Moreover, it is extremely computationally expensive for a \{NB\} classifier to compute class conditional independence for a dataset with high dimensional attributes. Thus, in the second proposed hybrid \{NB\} classifier, we employ a \{DT\} induction to select a comparatively more important subset of attributes for the production of na√Øve assumption of class conditional independence. We tested the performances of the two proposed hybrid algorithms against those of the existing \{DT\} and \{NB\} classifiers respectively using the classification accuracy, precision, sensitivity-specificity analysis, and 10-fold cross validation on 10 real benchmark datasets from \{UCI\} (University of California, Irvine) machine learning repository. The experimental results indicate that the proposed methods have produced impressive results in the classification of real life challenging multi-class problems. They are also able to automatically extract the most valuable training datasets and identify the most effective attributes for the description of instances from noisy complex training databases with large dimensions of attributes. },

  abstract = {Abstract Detection of cyber-based attacks on computer networks continues to be a relevant and challenging area of research. Daily reports of incidents appear in public media including major ex-filtrations of data for the purposes of stealing identities, credit card numbers, and intellectual property as well as to take control of network resources. Methods used by attackers constantly change in order to defeat techniques employed by information technology (IT) teams intended to discover or block intrusions. ‚ÄúZero Day‚Äù attacks whose ‚Äúsignatures‚Äù are not yet in \{IT\} databases are continually being uncovered. Machine learning approaches have been widely used to increase the effectiveness of intrusion detection platforms. While some machine learning techniques are effective at detecting certain types of attacks, there are no known methods that can be applied universally and achieve consistent results for multiple attack types. The focus of our research is the development of a framework that combines the outputs of multiple learners in order to improve the efficacy of network intrusion on data that contains instances of multiple classes of attacks. We have chosen the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) as the core learning algorithm due to recent research that suggests that \{ELMs\} are straightforward to implement, computationally efficient and have excellent learning performance characteristics on par with the Support Vector Machine (SVM), one of the most widely used and best performing machine learning platforms (Liu, Gao, &amp; Li, 2012). We introduce the novel Multiple Adaptive Reduced Kernel Extreme Learning Machine (MARK-ELM) which combines Multiple Kernel Boosting (Xia &amp; Hoi, 2013) with the Multiple Classification Reduced Kernel \{ELM\} (Deng, Zheng, &amp; Zhang, 2013). We tested this approach on several machine learning datasets as well as the \{KDD\} Cup 99 (Hettich &amp; Bay, 1999) intrusion detection dataset. Our results indicate that MARK-ELM works well for the majority of University of California, Irvine (UCI) Machine Learning Repository small datasets and is scalable for larger datasets. For \{UCI\} datasets we achieved performance similar to the \{MKBoost\} Support Vector Machine (SVM) approach. In our experiments we demonstrate that MARK-ELM achieves superior detection rates and much lower false alarm rates than other approaches on intrusion detection data. },

In high dimensional data classification, the performance of a classifier often depends on the feature subset used for classification. In this paper, we introduce a greedy feature selection method using mutual information. This method combines both feature‚Äìfeature mutual information and feature‚Äìclass mutual information to find an optimal subset of features to minimize redundancy and to maximize relevance among features. The effectiveness of the selected feature subset is evaluated using multiple classifiers on multiple datasets. The performance of our method both in terms of classification accuracy and execution time performance, has been found significantly high for twelve real-life datasets of varied dimensionality and number of instances when compared with several competing feature selection techniques. },

The hierarchical clustering algorithm provided the \{SVM\} with fewer, abstracted, and higher-qualified training instances that are derived from the \{KDD\} Cup 1999 training set. It was able to greatly shorten the training time, but also improve the performance of resultant SVM. The simple feature selection procedure was applied to eliminate unimportant features from the training set so the obtained \{SVM\} model could classify the network traffic data more accurately. The famous \{KDD\} Cup 1999 dataset was used to evaluate the proposed system. Compared with other intrusion detection systems that are based on the same dataset, this system showed better performance in the detection of DoS and Probe attacks, and the beset performance in overall accuracy. },

Techniques such as pattern recognition and the data mining of network events are often used by intrusion detection systems to classify the network events as either normal events or attack events. Our research study claims that the Hidden Na√Øve Bayes (HNB) model can be applied to intrusion detection problems that suffer from dimensionality, highly correlated features and high network data stream volumes. HNB is a data mining model that relaxes the Na√Øve Bayes method‚Äôs conditional independence assumption. Our experimental results show that the HNB model exhibits a superior overall performance in terms of accuracy, error rate and misclassification cost compared with the traditional Na√Øve Bayes model, leading extended Na√Øve Bayes models and the Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD) Cup 1999 winner. Our model performed better than other leading state-of-the art models, such as SVM, in predictive accuracy. The results also indicate that our model significantly improves the accuracy of detecting denial-of-services (DoS) attacks.},

In this study, a novel probabilistic approach is proposed effectively to forecast and detect network intrusions. It uses a Markov chain for probabilistic modeling of abnormal events in network systems. First, to define the network states, we perform K-means clustering, and then we introduce the concept of an outlier factor. Based on the defined states, the degree of abnormality of the incoming data is stochastically measured in real-time. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated through experiments using the well-known \{DARPA\} 2000 data set and further analyzes. The proposed approach achieves high detection performance while representing the level of attacks in stages. In particular, our approach is shown to be very robust to training data sets and the number of states in the Markov model. },

  abstract = {Many researches have argued that Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) can improve the performance of intrusion detection systems (IDS) when compared with traditional methods. However for ANN-based IDS, detection precision, especially for low-frequent attacks, and detection stability are still needed to be enhanced. In this paper, we propose a new approach, called FC-ANN, based on ANN and fuzzy clustering, to solve the problem and help IDS achieve higher detection rate, less false positive rate and stronger stability. The general procedure of FC-ANN is as follows: firstly fuzzy clustering technique is used to generate different training subsets. Subsequently, based on different training subsets, different ANN models are trained to formulate different base models. Finally, a meta-learner, fuzzy aggregation module, is employed to aggregate these results. Experimental results on the KDD CUP 1999 dataset show that our proposed new approach, FC-ANN, outperforms BPNN and other well-known methods such as decision tree, the na√É¬Øve Bayes in terms of detection precision and detection stability.},

To reduce the noise generated by feature differences, we propose a modified kernel function U-RBF, with the mean and mean square difference values of feature attributes embedded in kernel function RBF. Then, given the oscillation problem that usually occurs in traditional incremental SVM‚Äôs follow-up learning process, we present a reserved set strategy which can keep those samples that are more likely to be the support vectors in the following computation process. Moreover, in order to shorten the training time, a concentric circle method is suggested to be used in selecting samples to form the reserved set. Academic researches and data experiments show that RS-ISVM can ease the oscillation phenomenon in the learning process and achieve pretty good performance, meanwhile, its reliability is relative high.},

  abstract = {As recent Internet threats are evolving more rapidly than ever before, one of the major challenges in designing an intrusion detection system is to provide early and accurate detection of emerging threats. In this study, a novel framework is developed for fully unsupervised training and online anomaly detection. The framework is designed so that an initial model is constructed and then it gradually evolves according to the current state of online data without any human intervention. In the framework, a self-organizing map (SOM) that is seamlessly combined with K-means clustering is transformed into an adaptive and dynamic algorithm suitable for real-time processing. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated through experiments using the well-known \{KDD\} Cup 1999 data set and further experiments using the honeypot data recently collected from Kyoto University. It is shown that the proposed approach can significantly increase the detection rate while the false alarm rate remains low. In particular, it is capable of detecting new types of attacks at the earliest possible time. },

  abstract = {Abstract Anomaly based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) learn normal and anomalous behavior by analyzing network traffic in various benchmark datasets. Common challenges for \{IDSs\} are large amounts of data to process, low detection rates and high rates of false alarms. In this paper, a technique based on the Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machine (OS-ELM) is presented for intrusion detection. The proposed technique uses alpha profiling to reduce the time complexity while irrelevant features are discarded using an ensemble of Filtered, Correlation and Consistency based feature selection techniques. Instead of sampling, beta profiling is used to reduce the size of the training dataset. For performance evaluation of proposed technique the standard NSL-KDD 2009 (Network Security Laboratory-Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining) dataset is used. In this paper time and space complexity of the proposed technique is also discussed. The experimental results yielded an accuracy of 98.66% with a false positive rate of 1.74% and a detection time of 2.43 s for binary class NSL-KDD dataset. The proposed \{IDS\} achieve 97.67% of accuracy with 1.74% of false positive rate in 2.65 s of detection time for multi-class NSL-KDD dataset. The Kyoto University benchmark dataset is also used to test the proposed IDS. Accuracy of 96.37% with false positive rate of 5.76% is yielded by the proposed technique. The proposed technique outperforms other published techniques in terms of accuracy, false positive rate and detection time. Based on the experimental results achieved, we conclude that the proposed technique is an efficient method for network intrusion detection. },

This paper analyzes the reason for the difficulty in handling these problems by traditional evolved detectors, and then proposes a method of evolving boundary detectors to solve them. This method uses an improved detector generation algorithm based on evolutionary search to generate boundary detectors. The boundary detectors constructed by an aggressive interpretation are allowed to cover a part of self region. The aggressiveness controlled by boundary threshold can convert some volume of self sample into the fitness of boundary detector. This makes them enable to eliminate the holes on the boundary and have an opportunity to detect the deceiving anomalies hidden in the self region. Experiments are carried out using both 2-dimensional dataset and real world dataset. The former was designed to demonstrate intuitively that boundary detectors can cover the holes on the boundary, while the latter was to show that boundary detectors can detect the deceiving anomalies. },

Several intrusion detection systems have been developed to protect networks using different statistical methods and machine learning techniques. This study aims to design a model that deals with real intrusion detection problems in data analysis and classify network data into normal and abnormal behaviors. This study proposes a multi-level hybrid intrusion detection model that uses support vector machine and extreme learning machine to improve the efficiency of detecting known and unknown attacks. A modified K-means algorithm is also proposed to build a high-quality training dataset that contributes significantly to improving the performance of classifiers. The modified K-means is used to build new small training datasets representing the entire original training dataset, significantly reduce the training time of classifiers, and improve the performance of intrusion detection system. The popular \{KDD\} Cup 1999 dataset is used to evaluate the proposed model. Compared with other methods based on the same dataset, the proposed model shows high efficiency in attack detection, and its accuracy (95.75%) is the best performance thus far. },

  abstract = {Abstract Several algorithms for clustering data streams based on k-Means have been proposed in the literature. However, most of them assume that the number of clusters, k, is known a priori by the user and can be kept fixed throughout the data analysis process. Besides the difficulty in choosing k, data stream clustering imposes several challenges to be addressed, such as addressing non-stationary, unbounded data that arrive in an online fashion. In this paper, we propose a Fast Evolutionary Algorithm for Clustering data streams (FEAC-Stream) that allows estimating k automatically from data in an online fashion. FEAC-Stream uses the Page‚ÄìHinkley Test to detect eventual degradation in the quality of the induced clusters, thereby triggering an evolutionary algorithm that re-estimates k accordingly. FEAC-Stream relies on the assumption that clusters of (partially unknown) data can provide useful information about the dynamics of the data stream. We illustrate the potential of FEAC-Stream in a set of experiments using both synthetic and real-world data streams, comparing it to four related algorithms, namely: CluStream-OMRk, CluStream-BkM, StreamKM++-OMRk and StreamKM++-BkM. The obtained results show that FEAC-Stream provides good data partitions and that it can detect, and accordingly react to, data changes. },

  abstract = {Abstract Artificial Immune System (AIS) is inspired from Biological Immune System (BIS) and demonstrates a lot of interesting facets and intelligence that include self-learning, self adaption, self regulatory, distributed with self/non-self detection capabilities. Due to these astonishing qualities \{AIS\} are predominantly used in anomaly detection where anomalies are treated as non-self that needs to be detected. Therefore, \{AIS\} appears appropriate for development of a proactive system to identify and prevent novel and unseen anomalies. This paper presents ‚ÄúAn Efficient Proactive Artificial Immune System based Anomaly Detection and Prevention System (EPAADPS)‚Äù which embodies immune attributes to distinguish self and non-self in quest to identify and prevent novel, unseen anomalies. Negative Selection Algorithm (NSA) is a key \{AIS\} concept and is used for anomaly detection in various publications. Despite its relative success, detector selection and thereafter anomaly detection demands a more effective algorithm. This paper put forwards concept of self-tuning of detectors and detector power in \{NSA\} with the intension to make a detector evolve and facilitate better and correct self and non-self coverage. Thereafter, agents accompanying detectors collaborate and communicate between themselves to proactively discover correct anomalies and then take appropriate preventive measures. The performance of \{EPAADPS\} is contrasted with closely related state of art \{RNS\} algorithm using real valued representation and Euclidean distance. Experimental results revels promising \{EPAADPS\} performance which very comfortably outperforms the RNS. Furthermore, these results also demonstrate that \{EPAADPS\} shows remarkable resilience and intelligence in detecting novel unseen anomalies and with preventive measures to overcome the threat perception. },

A few approaches have been proposed to address this problem. Most of them, however, are on quadratic or even cubic time complexities w.r.t. data set size n. More importantly, the F-scores (harmonic mean of precision and recall) of the existing approaches are not satisfactory. Compared with the existing solutions to RCE, this paper proposes a novel approach with a linear time complexity and achieves a higher F-score of mining results. The key steps of our approach are to reduce search space by performing wavelet analysis on the data density function, and then refine the coarse mining result in the reduced search space via fine-grained metrics. A solid theoretical analysis is conducted to prove the feasibility of our solution, and extensive experiments on real data sets further verify its effectiveness and efficiency. },

  abstract = {Abstract Anomaly based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) learn normal and anomalous behavior by analyzing network traffic in various benchmark datasets. Common challenges for \{IDSs\} are large amounts of data to process, low detection rates and high rates of false alarms. In this paper, a technique based on the Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machine (OS-ELM) is presented for intrusion detection. The proposed technique uses alpha profiling to reduce the time complexity while irrelevant features are discarded using an ensemble of Filtered, Correlation and Consistency based feature selection techniques. Instead of sampling, beta profiling is used to reduce the size of the training dataset. For performance evaluation of proposed technique the standard NSL-KDD 2009 (Network Security Laboratory-Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining) dataset is used. In this paper time and space complexity of the proposed technique is also discussed. The experimental results yielded an accuracy of 98.66% with a false positive rate of 1.74% and a detection time of 2.43 s for binary class NSL-KDD dataset. The proposed \{IDS\} achieve 97.67% of accuracy with 1.74% of false positive rate in 2.65 s of detection time for multi-class NSL-KDD dataset. The Kyoto University benchmark dataset is also used to test the proposed IDS. Accuracy of 96.37% with false positive rate of 5.76% is yielded by the proposed technique. The proposed technique outperforms other published techniques in terms of accuracy, false positive rate and detection time. Based on the experimental results achieved, we conclude that the proposed technique is an efficient method for network intrusion detection. },

  abstract = {Identification of attacks by a network intrusion detection system (NIDS) is an important task. In signature or rule based detection, the previously encountered attacks are modeled, and signatures/rules are extracted. These rules are used to detect such attacks in future, but in anomaly or outlier detection system, the normal network traffic is modeled. Any deviation from the normal model is deemed to be an outlier/ attack. Data mining and machine learning techniques are widely used in offline NIDS. Unsupervised and supervised learning techniques differ the way NIDS dataset is treated. The characteristic features of unsupervised and supervised learning are finding patterns in data, detecting outliers, and determining a learned function for input features, generalizing the data instances respectively. The intuition is that if these two techniques are combined, better performance may be obtained. Hence, in this paper the advantages of unsupervised and supervised techniques are inherited in the proposed hierarchical model and devised into three stages to detect attacks in NIDS dataset. NIDS dataset is clustered using Dirichlet process (DP) clustering based on the underlying data distribution. Iteratively on each cluster, local denser areas are identified using local outlier factor (LOF) which in turn is discretized into four bins of separation based on LOF score. Further, in each bin the normal data instances are modeled using one class classifier (OCC). A combination of Density Estimation method, Reconstruction method, and Boundary methods are used for OCC model. A product rule combination of the threemethods takes into consideration the strengths of each method in building a stronger OCC model. Any deviation from this model is considered as an attack. Experiments are conducted on KDD CUP'99 and SSENet-2011 datasets. The results show that the proposed model is able to identify attacks with higher detection rate and low false alarms.},

  abstract = {Abstract In this paper, we introduce a new machine-learning-based data classification algorithm that is applied to network intrusion detection. The basic task is to classify network activities (in the network log as connection records) as normal or abnormal while minimizing misclassification. Although different classification models have been developed for network intrusion detection, each of them has its strengths and weaknesses, including the most commonly applied Support Vector Machine (SVM) method and the Clustering based on Self-Organized Ant Colony Network (CSOACN). Our new approach combines the \{SVM\} method with \{CSOACNs\} to take the advantages of both while avoiding their weaknesses. Our algorithm is implemented and evaluated using a standard benchmark \{KDD99\} data set. Experiments show that \{CSVAC\} (Combining Support Vectors with Ant Colony) outperforms \{SVM\} alone or \{CSOACN\} alone in terms of both classification rate and run-time efficiency. },

In this paper, we analyze the possibility of using data stream mining for enhancing the security of AMI through an intrusion detection system (IDS), which is a second line of defense after the primary security methods of encryption, authentication, authorization, etc. We propose a realistic and reliable IDS architecture for the whole AMI system, which consists of individual IDSs for three different levels of AMI's components: smart meter, data concentrator, and AMI headend. We also explore the performances of various existing state-of-the-art data stream mining algorithms on a publicly available IDS data set, namely, the KDD Cup 1999 data set. Then, we conduct a feasibility analysis of using these existing data stream mining algorithms, which exhibit varying levels of accuracies, memory requirements, and running times, for the distinct IDSs at AMI's three different components. Our analysis identifies different candidate algorithms for the different AMI components' IDSs, respectively.},

  abstract = {Detection of Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks has attracted researchers since 1990s. A variety of detection systems has been proposed to achieve this task. Unlike the existing approaches based on machine learning and statistical analysis, the proposed system treats traffic records as images and detection of DoS attacks as a computer vision problem. A multivariate correlation analysis approach is introduced to accurately depict network traffic records and to convert the records into their respective images. The images of network traffic records are used as the observed objects of our proposed DoS attack detection system, which is developed based on a widely used dissimilarity measure, namely Earth Mover's Distance (EMD). EMD takes cross-bin matching into account and provides a more accurate evaluation on the dissimilarity between distributions than some other well-known dissimilarity measures, such as Minkowski-form distance Lp and X2 statistics. These unique merits facilitate our proposed system with effective detection capabilities. To evaluate the proposed EMD-based detection system, ten-fold cross-validations are conducted using KDD Cup 99 dataset and ISCX 2012 IDS Evaluation dataset. The results presented in the system evaluation section illustrate that our detection system can detect unknown DoS attacks and achieves 99.95 percent detection accuracy on KDD Cup 99 dataset and 90.12 percent detection accuracy on ISCX 2012 IDS evaluation dataset with processing capability of approximately 59,000 traffic records per second.},

In this paper, we propose a mutual information based algorithm that analytically selects the optimal feature for classification. This mutual information based feature selection algorithm can handle linearly and nonlinearly dependent data features. Its effectiveness is evaluated in the cases of network intrusion detection. An Intrusion Detection System (IDS), named Least Square Support Vector Machine based IDS (LSSVM-IDS), is built using the features selected by our proposed feature selection algorithm. The performance of LSSVM-IDS is evaluated using three intrusion detection evaluation datasets, namely KDD Cup 99, NSL-KDD and Kyoto 2006+ dataset. The evaluation results show that our feature selection algorithm contributes more critical features for LSSVM-IDS to achieve better accuracy and lower computational cost compared with the state-of-the-art methods.},

Furthermore, intrusion detection in the new distributed architectures is now a major requirement. In this paper, we propose two online Adaboost-based intrusion detection algorithms. In the first algorithm, a traditional online Adaboost process is used where decision stumps are used as weak classifiers. In the second algorithm, an improved online Adaboost process is proposed, and online Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) are used as weak classifiers. We further propose a distributed intrusion detection framework, in which a local parameterized detection model is constructed in each node using the online Adaboost algorithm. A global detection model is constructed in each node by combining the local parametric models using a small number of samples in the node. This combination is achieved using an algorithm based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) and support vector machines. The global model in each node is used to detect intrusions. Experimental results show that the improved online Adaboost process with GMMs obtains a higher detection rate and a lower false alarm rate than the traditional online Adaboost process that uses decision stumps. Both the algorithms outperform existing intrusion detection algorithms. It is also shown that our PSO, and SVM-based algorithm effectively combines the local detection models into the global model in each node; the global model in a node can handle the intrusion types that are found in other nodes, without sharing the samples of these intrusion types.},

  abstract = {Clustering of big data has received much attention recently. In this paper, we present a new clusiVAT algorithm and compare it with four other popular data clustering algorithms. Three of the four comparison methods are based on the well known, classical batch k-means model. Specifically, we use k-means, single pass k-means, online k-means, and clustering using representatives (CURE) for numerical comparisons. clusiVAT is based on sampling the data, imaging the reordered distance matrix to estimate the number of clusters in the data visually, clustering the samples using a relative of single linkage (SL), and then noniteratively extending the labels to the rest of the data-set using the nearest prototype rule. Previous work has established that clusiVAT produces true SL clusters in compact-separated data. We have performed experiments to show that k-means and its modified algorithms suffer from initialization issues that cause many failures. On the other hand, clusiVAT needs no initialization, and almost always finds partitions that accurately match ground truth labels in labeled data. CURE also finds SL type partitions but is much slower than the other four algorithms. In our experiments, clusiVAT proves to be the fastest and most accurate of the five algorithms; e.g., it recovers 97% of the ground truth labels in the real world KDD-99 cup data (4292637 samples in 41 dimensions) in 76 s.},

In this paper, we address these two issues of Accuracy and Efficiency using Conditional Random Fields and Layered Approach. We demonstrate that high attack detection accuracy can be achieved by using Conditional Random Fields and high efficiency by implementing the Layered Approach. Experimental results on the benchmark KDD '99 intrusion data set show that our proposed system based on Layered Conditional Random Fields outperforms other well-known methods such as the decision trees and the naive Bayes. The improvement in attack detection accuracy is very high, particularly, for the U2R attacks (34.8 percent improvement) and the R2L attacks (34.5 percent improvement). Statistical Tests also demonstrate higher confidence in detection accuracy for our method. Finally, we show that our system is robust and is able to handle noisy data without compromising performance.},

  abstract = {Anomaly detection has been an important research topic in data mining and machine learning. Many real-world applications such as intrusion or credit card fraud detection require an effective and efficient framework to identify deviated data instances. However, most anomaly detection methods are typically implemented in batch mode, and thus cannot be easily extended to large-scale problems without sacrificing computation and memory requirements. In this paper, we propose an online oversampling principal component analysis (osPCA) algorithm to address this problem, and we aim at detecting the presence of outliers from a large amount of data via an online updating technique. Unlike prior principal component analysis (PCA)-based approaches, we do not store the entire data matrix or covariance matrix, and thus our approach is especially of interest in online or large-scale problems. By oversampling the target instance and extracting the principal direction of the data, the proposed osPCA allows us to determine the anomaly of the target instance according to the variation of the resulting dominant eigenvector. Since our osPCA need not perform eigen analysis explicitly, the proposed framework is favored for online applications which have computation or memory limitations. Compared with the well-known power method for PCA and other popular anomaly detection algorithms, our experimental results verify the feasibility of our proposed method in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.},

There are two main challenges: how to cluster with the best representatives and how to handle the evolving patterns that are important characteristics of streaming data with dynamic distributions. We employ the Affinity Propagation (AP) algorithm presented in 2007 by Frey and Dueck for the first challenge, as it offers good guarantees of clustering optimality for selecting exemplars. The second challenging problem is solved by change detection. The presented StrAP algorithm combines AP with a statistical change point detection test; the clustering model is rebuilt whenever the test detects a change in the underlying data distribution. Besides the validation on two benchmark data sets, the presented algorithm is validated on a real-world application, monitoring the data flow of jobs submitted to the EGEE grid.},

  abstract = {Outlier detection has been an active area of research for a few decades. We propose a new definition of outlier that is useful for high-dimensional data. According to this definition, given a dictionary of atoms learned using the sparse coding objective, the outlierness of a data point depends jointly on two factors: the frequency of each atom in reconstructing all data points (or its negative log activity ratio, NLAR) and the strength by which it is used in reconstructing the current point. A Rarity based Outlier Detection algorithm in a Sparse coding framework (RODS) that consists of two components, NLAR learning and outlier scoring, is developed. This algorithm is unsupervised; both the offline and online variants are presented. It is governed by very few manually-tunable parameters and operates in linear time. We demonstrate the superior performance of the RODS in comparison with various state-of-the-art outlier detection algorithms on several benchmark datasets. We also demonstrate its effectiveness using three real-world case studies: saliency detection in images, abnormal event detection in videos, and change detection in data streams. Our evaluations shows that RODS outperforms competing algorithms reported in the outlier detection, saliency detection, video event detection, and change detection literature.},

Consider a graph learned from labelled and unlabelled data, and the graph being updated dynamically for accommodating online data adding and retiring. In learning from the resulting non stationary graph, we augment and de-augment paths to update max-flow with a theoretical guarantee that the updated max-flow equals to that from batch retraining. For classification, we compute min-cut over current max-flow, so that minimized number of similar sample pairs are classified into distinct classes.

  abstract = {Outlier detection is an important task in data mining, with applications ranging from intrusion detection to human gait analysis. With the growing need to analyze high speed data streams, the task of outlier detection becomes even more challenging as traditional outlier detection techniques can no longer assume that all the data can be stored for processing. While the well-known Local Outlier Factor (LOF) algorithm has an incremental version, it assumes unbounded memory to keep all previous data points. In this paper, we propose a memory efficient incremental local outlier (MiLOF) detection algorithm for data streams, and a more flexible version (MiLOF_F), both have an accuracy close to Incremental LOF but within a fixed memory bound. Our experimental results show that both proposed approaches have better memory and time complexity than Incremental LOF while having comparable accuracy. In addition, we show that MiLOF_F is robust to changes in the number of data points, the number of underlying clusters and the number of dimensions in the data stream. These results show that MiLOF/MiLOF_F are well suited to application environments with limited memory (e.g., wireless sensor networks), and can be applied to high volume data streams.},

In this paper, we present a DoS attack detection system that uses multivariate correlation analysis (MCA) for accurate network traffic characterization by extracting the geometrical correlations between network traffic features. Our MCA-based DoS attack detection system employs the principle of anomaly based detection in attack recognition. This makes our solution capable of detecting known and unknown DoS attacks effectively by learning the patterns of legitimate network traffic only. Furthermore, a triangle-area-based technique is proposed to enhance and to speed up the process of MCA. The effectiveness of our proposed detection system is evaluated using KDD Cup 99 data set, and the influences of both non-normalized data and normalized data on the performance of the proposed detection system are examined. The results show that our system outperforms two other previously developed state-of-the-art approaches in terms of detection accuracy.},

  abstract = {The advent of the smart grid promises to usher in an era that will bring intelligence, efficiency, and optimality to the power grid. Most of these changes will occur as an Internet-like communications network is superimposed on top of the current power grid using wireless mesh network technologies with the 802.15.4, 802.11, and WiMAX standards. Each of these will expose the power grid to cybersecurity threats. In order to address this issue, this work proposes a distributed intrusion detection system for smart grids (SGDIDS) by developing and deploying an intelligent module, the analyzing module (AM), in multiple layers of the smart grid. Multiple AMs will be embedded at each level of the smart grid-the home area networks (HANs), neighborhood area networks (NANs), and wide area networks (WANs)-where they will use the support vector machine (SVM) and artificial immune system (AIS) to detect and classify malicious data and possible cyberattacks. AMs at each level are trained using data that is relevant to their level and will also be able to communicate in order to improve detection. Simulation results demonstrate that this is a promising methodology for supporting the optimal communication routing and improving system security through the identification of malicious network traffic.},

  abstract = {As the Internet services spread all over the world, many kinds and a large number of security threats are increasing. Therefore, intrusion detection systems, which can effectively detect intrusion accesses, have attracted attention. This paper describes a novel fuzzy class-association-rule mining method based on genetic network programming (GNP) for detecting network intrusions. GNP is an evolutionary optimization technique, which uses directed graph structures instead of strings in genetic algorithm or trees in genetic programming, which leads to enhancing the representation ability with compact programs derived from the reusability of nodes in a graph structure. By combining fuzzy set theory with GNP, the proposed method can deal with the mixed database that contains both discrete and continuous attributes and also extract many important class-association rules that contribute to enhancing detection ability. Therefore, the proposed method can be flexibly applied to both misuse and anomaly detection in network-intrusion-detection problems. Experimental results with KDD99Cup and DARPA98 databases from MIT Lincoln Laboratory show that the proposed method provides competitively high detection rates compared with other machine-learning techniques and GNP with crisp data mining.},

However, misuse detection is weak in detecting brand new attacks, while anomaly detection has a defect of high positive false rate. In this paper, a unified detection method is proposed to integrate misuse detection and anomaly detection to overcome their disadvantages. In addition, GNP-based class association rule mining method extracts an overwhelming number of rules which contain much redundant and irrelevant information. Therefore, in this paper, an efficient class association rule-pruning method is proposed based on matching degree and genetic algorithm (GA). In the first stage, a matching degree-based method is applied to preprune the rules in order to improve the efficiency of the GA. In the second stage, the GA is implemented to pick up the effective rules among the rules remaining in the first stage. Simulations on KDDCup99 show the high performance of the proposed method. ¬© 2012 Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.},

Currently, lots of methods are used to solve this issue, but lower detection rate of these original models cannot satisfy complex Internet environment. In this paper, we propose a novel intrusion detection model‚ÄìBayesian Network-based binary quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (BQPSO-BN). Since the classical QPSO algorithm only operates in continuous and real-valued space, and the problem of Bayesian networks learning is in discrete space, we redefine the position vector and the distance between two positions, and adjust the iterative equations of QPSO to binary search space. Experiment results with KDD‚Äô99 dataset show that BQPSO-BN is an efficient and effective algorithm and has better convergence speed compared with BPSO-BN and GA-BN models. },

Performing anomaly detection in real time places hard requirement on the algorithms used. It makes many detection techniques based on proposed data mining algorithms less suitable to be used under real-time network circumstances. To address the problem, a novel anomaly detection algorithm using time-stamped clustering is proposed. In this paper, the normality model used for detection is the clustering result of BIRCH. Once a cluster is generated or modified in the tree index of BIRCH, it will be marked by a lasted modified time-stamp and frequent item. Using each cluster‚Äôs time-stamp and frequent item, the algorithm can dynamically remove some expired clusters from the model, and can also produce some new clusters that makes our clustering method more suitable for the real network environment. Experiments with the KDDCUP 1999 dataset show that our algorithm is less sensitive to noise data objects than ADWICE and has lower computer resource consumption.},

In this work, instead of constructing a large number of features from massive network traffic, the authors aim to select the most important features and use them to detect intrusions in a fast and effective manner. The authors first employed several techniques, that is, information gain (IG), wrapper with Bayesian networks (BN) and Decision trees (C4.5), to select important subsets of features for network intrusion detection based on KDD'99 data. The authors then validate the feature selection schemes in a real network test bed to detect distributed denial-of-service attacks. The feature selection schemes are extensively evaluated based on the two data sets. The empirical results demonstrate that with only the most important 10 features selected from all the original 41 features, the attack detection accuracy almost remains the same or even becomes better based on both BN and C4.5 classifiers. Constructing fewer features can also improve the efficiency of network intrusion detection.},

Many of these big data sets are generated in network environment and are characterized by a dauntingly large size and high dimensionality which pose great challenges for detecting useful knowledge and patterns, such as network traffic anomalies, from them. In this paper, we study the problem of anomaly detection in big network connection data sets and propose an outlier detection technique, called Adaptive Stream Projected Outlier deTector (A-SPOT), to detect anomalies from large data sets using a novel adaptive subspace analysis approach. A case study of A-SPOT is conducted in this paper by deploying it to the 1999 \{KDD\} \{CUP\} anomaly detection application. Innovative approaches for training data generation, anomaly classification and false positive reduction are proposed in this paper as well to better tailor A-SPOT to deal with the case study. Experimental results demonstrate that A-SPOT is effective and efficient in detecting anomalies from network data sets and outperforms existing detection methods. },

  abstract = {Abstract We propose a nature-inspired approach to estimate the probability density function (pdf) used for data clustering based on the optimum-path forest algorithm (OPFC). \{OPFC\} interprets a dataset as a graph, whose nodes are the samples and each sample is connected to its k-nearest neighbors in a given feature space (a k-nn graph). The nodes of the graph are weighted by their pdf values and the pdf is computed based on the distances between the samples and their k-nearest neighbors. Once the k-nn graph is defined, \{OPFC\} finds one sample (root) at each maximum of the pdf and propagates one optimum-path tree (cluster) from each root to the remaining samples of its dome. Clustering effectiveness will depend on the pdf estimation, and the proposed approach efficiently computes the best value of k for a given application. We validate our approach in the context of intrusion detection in computer networks. First, we compare \{OPFC\} with data clustering based on k-means, and self-organization maps. Second, we evaluate several metaheuristic techniques to find the best value of k. },

  abstract = {Classifiers based on radial basis function neural networks have a number of useful properties that can be exploited in many practical applications. Using sample data, it is possible to adjust their parameters (weights), to optimize their structure, and to select appropriate input features (attributes). Moreover, interpretable rules can be extracted from a trained classifier and input samples can be identified that cannot be classified with a sufficient degree of #certainty#. These properties support an analysis of radial basis function classifiers and allow for an adaption to #novel# kinds of input samples in a real-world application. In this article, we outline these properties and show how they can be exploited in the field of intrusion detection (detection of network-based misuse). Intrusion detection plays an increasingly important role in securing computer networks. In this case study, we first compare the classification abilities of radial basis function classifiers, multilayer perceptrons, the neuro-fuzzy system NEFCLASS, decision trees, classifying fuzzy-k-means, support vector machines, Bayesian networks, and nearest neighbor classifiers. Then, we investigate the interpretability and understandability of the best paradigms found in the previous step. We show how structure optimization and feature selection for radial basis function classifiers can be done by means of evolutionary algorithms and compare this approach to decision trees optimized using certain pruning techniques. Finally, we demonstrate that radial basis function classifiers are basically able to detect novel attack types. The many advantageous properties of radial basis function classifiers could certainly be exploited in other application fields in a similar way.},

Radial basis function networks (RBF) Multilayer perceptrons (MLP) NEFCLASS (NC) is a neuro-fuzzy system for the classification of data into a number of crisp classes Decision trees (DT) Classifying fuzzy-k-means (CFKM) is based on the k-means clustering algorithm that assigns input vectors to clusters using a minimum distance assignment rule (e.g., a Euclidean distance). Support vector machines (SVM) Bayesian networks (BN) k-nearest-neighbor (kNN)



The key contribution of this article is an investigation of these properties of RBF in a particular application field: We show how these properties can be exploited in the field of intrusion detection As an example, we focus on the detection of network-based misuse. We investigate (i) The classification performance of RBF and some other classifier paradigms; (ii) The interpretability and understandability of rule sets either inherent in or extracted from RBF or other classifiers; (iii) The selection of input features and the optimization of structure parameters of a classifier (RBF and decision trees), and (iv) possibilities for a detection of novel kinds of attacks exploiting specific properties of RBF.
In this article, we consider 14 types of attacks or utilities that are used to initiate attacks (all are briefly referred to as at- tacks in the following): Anomaly, Back, Dict, Eject, Guest, Ipsweep, Land, Neptune, Nmap, Portsweep, Rootkit, Satan, Warezclient, and Warezmaster.

An individual classifier is now trained and evaluated for each combination of paradigm and one of the following four attacks: Back, Dict, Nmap, and Portsweep. These attacks belong to the following attack categories: portscans (Nmap, Portsweep), password guessing attacks (Dict), and denial-of-service attacks (Back). Appropriate input features‚Äîthe same for all classifier paradigms, selected from the 140 available features‚Äîand paradigm-specific parameters are determined manually. The number of used samples is 1300 (Nmap and Dict), 2900 (Back) and 8400 (Portsweep), respectively. These samples are used following a 5-fold cross-validation approach, i.e.,4 part are applied for training and 1 for validation. The ratio of attacks and non-attacks (the latter including data of other attack types) in each data set is approximately 50:50. This very specific property of the training and validation data is one reason why it is not possible to compare the numerical results given in the following to results published elsewhere for the DARPA data. Each classifier paradigm is trained until the respective error on training data‚Äîthe least-squares error in the case of MLP, for instance‚Äîcannot be reduced further (convergence criterion).
It should be mentioned that variance dominates bias in classification problems (cf. bias/variance dilemma). Thus, ‚Äò‚Äòsim-ple‚Äù classifiers with high bias but low variance, such as kNN, are able to yield high classification rate
Altogether, we can state: In a real application scenario it would not be possible to argue in favor of a certain classifier with the few results shown so far. These results give some first hints and we suggest the following further steps: ‚Äì Additional features should be computed and evaluated (e.g., features that evaluate the payload of transmitted packets in order to detect an attempt for login). ... In a second step, we will compare the interpretability of rule sets.
Interpretability of rules is rarely investigated in the field of IDS: Extracting rules from an anomaly based system is proposed in [57] , for instance, to automatically generate rules for new attacks for the open source IDS SNORT.
With interpretability we mean that the type of the rule sets is readable. That is, the rules can be represented in a human- intelligible form. In addition, understandability describes how easily rules can be understood by human domain experts 
Finally, we come back to the problem of rule extraction from SVM which is an active research field. Examples for extraction techniques can be found in [65‚Äì67], for instance. As a consequence, a minor modification of the learning task (e.g., slightly different data or parameters) may lead to an SVM with almost the same decision boundary, but different support vectors and, thus, different rules. This would be a very bad precondition for understandability
In a third step, we focus on the two tasks ‚Äò‚Äòfeature selection‚Äù and ‚Äò‚Äòmodel selection‚Äù (structure optimization) for RBF and DT.
We defined the RBFS paradigm in a way such that we can use it for novelty detection. Novelty detection could be used to support the detection of certain novel attack types, for example. The additional normalization term in the definition of a hid- den node‚Äôs activation indicates missing knowledge about incoming data.
The capabilities of this mechanism can be shown using a simple scenario composed of two very similar attack types, Dict and Guest, which makes the novelty detection rather difficult.
For the experiment, a feature selection was conducted and two appropriate features (independent and with high information gain) have been selected.
A data scenario has been constructed using 650 samples from the Dict set randomly mixed with 650 non-attack samples. After that, 360 samples from the Guest set have been selected (containing some duplicates) and mixed with 360 non-attack samples. These data are concatenated to build a sequential scenario in which we simulate a first phase where a Dict attack occurs and a second phase with a Guest attack. An RBFS is created using the first 500 samples, i.e., a detector for the Dict attack is trained. After that, the remaining 1160 samples are processed without adaptation.

  abstract = {An enormous amount of information is continually being produced in current research, which poses a challenge for data mining algorithms. Many of the problems in extremely active research areas, such as bioinformatics, security and intrusion detection and text mining, involve large or enormous datasets. These datasets pose serious problems for many data mining algorithms. One method to address very large datasets is data reduction. Among the most useful data reduction methods is simultaneous instance and feature selection. This method achieves a considerable reduction in the training data while maintaining, or even improving, the performance of the data-mining algorithm. However, it suffers from a high degree of scalability problems, even for medium-sized datasets. In this paper, we propose a new evolutionary simultaneous instance and feature selection algorithm that is scalable to millions of instances and thousands of features. This proposal is based on the divide-and-conquer principle combined with bookkeeping. The divide-and-conquer principle allows the execution of the algorithm in linear time. Furthermore, the proposed method is easy to implement using a parallel environment and can work without loading the entire dataset into memory. Using 50 medium-sized datasets, we will demonstrate our method‚Äôs ability to match the results of state-of-the-art instance and feature selection methods while significantly reducing the time requirements. Using 13 very large datasets, we will demonstrate the scalability of our proposal to millions of instances and thousands of features. },

  abstract = {Abstract In this age, big data applications are increasingly becoming the main focus of attention because of the enormous increment of data generation and storage that has taken place in the last years. This situation becomes a challenge when huge amounts of data are processed to extract knowledge because the data mining techniques are not adapted to the new space and time requirements. Furthermore, real-world data applications usually present a class distribution where the samples that belong to one class, which is precisely the main interest, are hugely outnumbered by the samples of the other classes. This circumstance, known as the class imbalance problem, complicates the learning process as the standard learning techniques do not correctly address this situation. In this work, we analyse the performance of several techniques used to deal with imbalanced datasets in the big data scenario using the Random Forest classifier. Specifically, oversampling, undersampling and cost-sensitive learning have been adapted to big data using MapReduce so that these techniques are able to manage datasets as large as needed providing the necessary support to correctly identify the underrepresented class. The Random Forest classifier provides a solid basis for the comparison because of its performance, robustness and versatility. An experimental study is carried out to evaluate the performance of the diverse algorithms considered. The results obtained show that there is not an approach to imbalanced big data classification that outperforms the others for all the data considered when using Random Forest. Moreover, even for the same type of problem, the best performing method is dependent on the number of mappers selected to run the experiments. In most of the cases, when the number of splits is increased, an improvement in the running times can be observed, however, this progress in times is obtained at the expense of a slight drop in the accuracy performance obtained. This decrement in the performance is related to the lack of density problem, which is evaluated in this work from the imbalanced data point of view, as this issue degrades the performance of classifiers in the imbalanced scenario more severely than in standard learning. },

  abstract = {Abstract Countering cyber threats, especially attack detection, is a challenging area of research in the field of information assurance. Intruders use polymorphic mechanisms to masquerade the attack payload and evade the detection techniques. Many supervised and unsupervised learning approaches from the field of machine learning and pattern recognition have been used to increase the efficacy of intrusion detection systems (IDSs). Supervised learning approaches use only labeled samples to train a classifier, but obtaining sufficient labeled samples is cumbersome, and requires the efforts of domain experts. However, unlabeled samples can easily be obtained in many real world problems. Compared to supervised learning approaches, semi-supervised learning (SSL) addresses this issue by considering large amount of unlabeled samples together with the labeled samples to build a better classifier. This paper proposes a novel fuzziness based semi-supervised learning approach by utilizing unlabeled samples assisted with supervised learning algorithm to improve the classifier‚Äôs performance for the IDSs. A single hidden layer feed-forward neural network (SLFN) is trained to output a fuzzy membership vector, and the sample categorization (low, mid, and high fuzziness categories) on unlabeled samples is performed using the fuzzy quantity. The classifier is retrained after incorporating each category separately into the original training set. The experimental results using this technique of intrusion detection on the NSL-KDD dataset show that unlabeled samples belonging to low and high fuzziness groups make major contributions to improve the classifier‚Äôs performance compared to existing classifiers e.g., naive bayes, support vector machine, random forests, etc. },

The data mining and network management research communities are interested in improving existing score-based network traffic anomaly detection techniques because of ample scopes to increase performance. In this paper, we present a multi-step outlier-based approach for detection of anomalies in network-wide traffic. We identify a subset of relevant traffic features and use it during clustering and anomaly detection. To support outlier-based network anomaly identification, we use the following modules: a mutual information and generalized entropy based feature selection technique to select a relevant non-redundant subset of features, a tree-based clustering technique to generate a set of reference points and an outlier score function to rank incoming network traffic to identify anomalies. We also design a fast distributed feature extraction and data preparation framework to extract features from raw network-wide traffic. We evaluate our approach in terms of detection rate, false positive rate, precision, recall and F-measure using several high dimensional synthetic and real-world datasets and find the performance superior in comparison to competing algorithms. },

  abstract = {Abstract In recent times there has been an increase in data availability in continuous data streams and clustering of this data has many advantages in data analysis. It is often the case that these data streams are not stationary, but evolve over time, and also that the clusters are not regular shapes but form arbitrary shapes in the data space. Previous techniques for clustering such data streams are either hybrid online / offline methods, windowed offline methods, or find only hyper-elliptical clusters. In this paper we present a fully online technique for clustering evolving data streams into arbitrary shaped clusters. It is a two stage technique that is accurate, robust to noise, computationally and memory efficient, with a low time penalty as the number of data dimensions increases. The first stage of the technique produces micro-clusters and the second stage combines these micro-clusters into macro-clusters. Dimensional stability and high speed is achieved through keeping the calculations both simple and minimal using hyper-spherical micro-clusters. By maintaining a graph structure, where the micro-clusters are the nodes and the edges are its pairs with intersecting micro-clusters, we minimise the calculations required for macro-cluster maintenance. The micro-clusters themselves are described in such a way that there is no calculation required for the core and shell regions and no separate definition of outer micro-clusters necessary. We demonstrate the ability of the proposed technique to join and separate macro-clusters as they evolve in a fully online manner. There are no other fully online techniques that the authors are aware of and so we compare the technique with popular online / offline hybrid alternatives for accuracy, purity and speed. The technique is then applied to real atmospheric science data streams and used to discover short term, long term and seasonal drift and their effects on anomaly detection. As well as having favourable computational characteristics, the technique can add analytic value over hyper-elliptical methods by characterising the cluster hyper-shape using Euclidean or fractal shape factors. Because the technique records macro-clusters as graphs, further analytic value accrues from characterising the order, degree, and completeness of the cluster-graphs as they evolve over time. },

But all features are not relevant and some of them may be redundant and contribute little to the detection process. Irrelevant and redundant features may lead to complex intrusion detection model as well as poor detection accuracy. In this paper, we propose and investigate a novel hybrid feature selection method to intrusion detection based on fusion of Extension Matrix (EM) and Genetic Algorithm (GA), which employs a combination of EM and GA through genetic operation, and it is capable of building an optimal detection model with only selected important features and their specific values. Experiment results show the achievement of high correct detection rates and tolerable low false positive rates based on benchmark KDD Cup 99 data sets. },

  abstract = { Abstract Negative Selection Algorithms (NSAs) have been widely used in anomaly detection. As the security issue becomes more complex, more and more anomaly detection schemes involve high-dimension data. NSAs however perform poorly on effectiveness and efficiency when dealing with high-dimension data. To address these issues, we propose a Neighborhood Negative Selection (NNS) algorithm in this paper. Instead of a single data point, NNS uses a neighborhood to represent a self sample (or a detector). As a result, the training efficiency is greatly improved. We further introduce a special matching mechanism to limit the negative effect of the dimensionality of a shape space and improve the detecting performance in high dimensions. The experimental results show that NNS can provide a more accurate and stable detection performance. Meanwhile, both theoretical analysis and experimental results show that NNS further improves the training efficiency. },

  abstract  = {Concept drift, change in the underlying distribution that data points come from, is an inevitable phenomenon in data streams. Due to increase in the number of data streams' applications such as network intrusion detection, weather forecasting, and detection of unconventional behavior in financial transactions; numerous researches have recently been conducted in the area of concept drift detection. An ideal method for concept drift detection should be able to rapidly and correctly identify changes in the underlying distribution of data points and adapt its model as quickly as possible while the memory and processing time is limited. In this paper, we propose a novel explicit method based on ensemble classifiers for detecting concept drift. The method processes samples one by one, and monitors the distribution of ensemble's error in order to detect probable drifts. After detection of a drift, a new classifier will be trained on the new concept in order to keep the model up-to-date. The proposed method has been evaluated on some artificial and real benchmark data sets. The experiments' results show that the proposed method is capable of detecting and adjusting to concept drifts from different types, and it has outperformed well-known state-of-the-art methods. Especially, in the case of high-speed concept drifts.},

The NSL-KDD dataset of network attacks was created in a military network by MIT Lincoln Labs. Then we will discuss and experiment some of the hybrid AI (Artificial Intelligence) classifiers that can be used for IDS, and finally we developed a Java software with three most efficient classifiers and compared it with other options. The outputs would show the detection accuracy and efficiency of the single and combined classifiers used. },

In the first step, offline learning is performed to achieve an appropriate detection model. Then the current model dynamically evolves to match the rapidly changing real-world data. To reduce the dimension of the quadratic programming (QP) problem emerging in the SVC, self-organizing map (SOM) and a replacement mechanism are used to summarize the incoming data. Thus, the proposed method can be efficiently and effectively useable in real time applications. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by a simulated dataset, three subsets extracted from the KDD Cup 99 dataset, and the keystroke dynamics dataset. Results illustrate capabilities of the proposed method in detection of new attacks as well as normal pattern changes over the time. },

   individual classification techniques, such system fails to provide the

   best possible attack detection rate. In this paper, we propose a new

   two-stage hybrid classification method using Support Vector Machine

   (SVM) as anomaly detection in the first stage, and Artificial Neural

   Network (ANN) as misuse detection in the second. The key idea is to

   combine the advantages of each technique to ameliorate classification

   accuracy along with a low probability of false positive. The first stage

   (Anomaly) detects abnormal activities that could be an intrusion. The

   second stage (Misuse) further analyze if there is a known attack and

   classifies the type of attack into four classes namely, Denial of

   Service (DoS), Remote to Local (R2L), User to Root (U2R) and Probe.

   Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms

   conventional model including individual classification of SVM and ANN

   algorithm. The empirical results demonstrate that the proposed system

   has a reliable degree of detecting anomaly activity over the network

   data. Simulation results of both stages are based on NSL-KDD datasets

   which is an enhanced version of KDD99 intrusion dataset.}},

Therefore, the need for protecting such data against hackers and intruders is at most importance. Many security systems were built for this purpose; Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are one of those systems. The main function of IDS is to monitor the incoming connections and detect attacks. In this paper, the researcher presented two models of IDS. In the first model, the Simple Genetic Algorithm (SGA) was used to build IDS, while in second model; Steady State Genetic Algorithm (SSGA) was used to build IDS. The evaluations and the experiments were performed using the NSL-KDD dataset. The experimental results demonstrated that performing an IDS using SGA gives higher performance results than using SSGA according to the value of Detection rate (DR) and number of new generated rules, also the training time for SGA experiments is shorter than the training time for SSGA. On other hand, SSGA based IDS achieved an average of False Positive Rate (FPR) that was relatively better than SGA based IDS.},

  abstract = {Despite its continuous improvement, cloud computing system is still vulnerable to malicious activities. This has necessitated in constructing an anomaly detection component for discovering anomalies in cloud environment. In this paper, an anomaly detection system at hypervisor layer named hypervisor detector is developed and evaluated to detect the malicious activities in cloud environment. Deployment of fuzzy systems in intrusion detection systems has the ability to detect the presence of uncertain and imprecise nature of anomalies in cloud environment. But they fail in constructing models based on target data. One of the successful approaches based on target data is integration of fuzzy systems with adaptation and learning proficiencies of neural network called adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) model. The hypervisor detector is designed and developed with ANFIS and is practiced with a hybrid algorithm, which is a combination of back propagation gradient descent technique with least square method. For experiments, DARPA's KDD cup dataset is used. The performance analysis and results show that the proposed hypervisor detector based on ANFIS is well designed to detect the anomalies in cloud environment with minimum false negative rate and high detection accuracy.},

The objective of this article is to prove that the choice of effective network traffic features and a proficient machine-learning paradigm enhances the detection accuracy of IDS. In this article, a rule-based approach with a family of six decision tree classifiers, namely Decision Stump, C4.5, Naive Baye's Tree, Random Forest, Random Tree and Representative Tree model to perform the detection of anomalous network pattern is introduced. In particular, the proposed swarm optimisation-based approach selects instances that compose training set and optimised decision tree operate over this trained set producing classification rules with improved coverage, classification capability and generalisation ability. Experiment with the Knowledge Discovery and Data mining (KDD) data set which have information on traffic pattern, during normal and intrusive behaviour shows that the proposed algorithm produces optimised decision rules and outperforms other machine-learning algorithm. },

Different metaheuristic techniques have been used for anomaly detector generation. Yet, reported literature has not studied the use of the multi-start metaheuristic method for detector generation. This paper proposes a hybrid approach for anomaly detection in large scale datasets using detectors generated based on multi-start metaheuristic method and genetic algorithms. The proposed approach has taken some inspiration of negative selection-based detector generation. The evaluation of this approach is performed using NSL-KDD dataset which is a modified version of the widely used \{KDD\} \{CUP\} 99 dataset. The results show its effectiveness in generating a suitable number of detectors with an accuracy of 96.1% compared to other competitors of machine learning algorithms. },

This paper proposes a novel two-tier classification models based on machine learning approaches Na{\"i}ve Bayes, certainty factor voting version of KNN classifiers and also Linear Discriminant Analysis for dimension reduction. Experimental results show a desirable and promising gain in detection rate and false alarm compared with other existing models. The model also trained by two generated balance training sets using SMOTE method to evaluate the chosen similarity measure for dealing with imbalanced network anomaly data sets. The two-tier model provides low computation time due to optimal dimension reduction and feature selection, as well as good detection rate against rare and complex attack types which are so dangerous because of their close similarity to normal behaviors like User to Root and Remote to Local. All evaluation processes experimented by NSL-KDD data set.},

One of the effective ways to achieve higher security is to use intrusion detection systems, which are software tools used to detect abnormal activities in the computer or network. One technical challenge in intrusion detection systems is the curse of high dimensionality. To overcome this problem, we propose a feature selection phase, which can be generally implemented in any intrusion detection system. In this work, we propose two feature selection algorithms and study the performance of using these algorithms compared to a mutual information-based feature selection method. These feature selection algorithms require the use of a feature goodness measure. We investigate using both a linear and a non-linear measure‚Äîlinear correlation coefficient and mutual information, for the feature selection. Further, we introduce an intrusion detection system that uses an improved machine learning based method, Least Squares Support Vector Machine. Experiments on \{KDD\} Cup 99 data set address that our proposed mutual information-based feature selection method results in detecting intrusions with higher accuracy, especially for remote to login (R2L) and user to remote (U2R) attacks. },

  abstract = {Abstract Network traffic monitoring is a very difficult task, given the amount of network traffic generated even in small networks. One approach to facilitate this task is network traffic summarization. Data summarization is a key concept in data mining. However, no current measures exist in order to facilitate the evaluation of summaries. This paper presents four metrics which can be used to characterize data summarization results. Conciseness and Information Loss have already been defined, but we modified Information Loss, due to the fact that it was biased towards recurring attributes across individual summaries. We also propose two additional metrics, Interestingness and Intelligibility. Using the proposed metrics, we evaluated existing summarization techniques on well known network traffic datasets. We also proposed a summarization technique, based on an existing one but incorporating the proposed metrics as objective function. In order to further demonstrate the usability of the metrics, we performed classification on summarized datasets, showing that the metrics can be used to facilitate the selection of summaries for performing data mining. Using the summarized datasets with a reasonable conciseness, we were able to achieve similar results in terms of accuracy, but at a fraction of the running time, proportional to the conciseness of the summarized dataset. },

  abstract = {Abstract Abnormal network traffic analysis has become an increasingly important research topic to protect computing infrastructures from intruders. Yet, it is challenging to accurately discover threats due to the high volume of network traffic. To have better knowledge about network intrusions, this paper focuses on designing a multi-level network detection method. Mainly, it is composed of three steps as (1) understanding hidden underlying patterns from network traffic data by creating reliable rules to identify network abnormality, (2) generating a predictive model to determine exact attack categories, and (3) integrating a visual analytics tool to conduct an interactive visual analysis and validate the identified intrusions with transparent reasons. To verify our approach, a broadly known intrusion dataset (i.e. NSL-KDD) is used. We found that the generated rules maintain a high performance rate and provide clear explanations. The proposed predictive model resulted about 96% of accuracy in detecting exact attack categories. With the interactive visual analysis, a significant difference among the attack categories was discovered by visually representing attacks in separated clusters. Overall, our multi-level detection method is well-suited for identifying hidden underlying patterns and attack categories by revealing the relationship among the features of network traffic data. },

  abstract = {The growing hierarchical self organizing map (GHSOM) has been shown to be an effective technique to facilitate anomaly detection. However, existing approaches based on \{GHSOM\} are not able to adapt online to the ever-changing anomaly detection. This results in low accuracy in identifying intrusions, particularly ‚Äúunknown‚Äù attacks. In this paper, we propose an adaptive \{GHSOM\} based approach (A-GHSOM) to network anomaly detection. It consists of four significant enhancements: enhanced threshold-based training, dynamic input normalization, feedback-based quantization error threshold adaptation, and prediction confidence filtering and forwarding. We first evaluate the A-GHSOM approach for intrusion detection using the KDD‚Äô99 dataset. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that compared with eight representative intrusion detection approaches, A-GHSOM achieves significant overall accuracy improvement and significant improvement in identifying ‚Äúunknown‚Äù attacks while maintaining low false-positive rates. It achieves an overall accuracy of 99.63%, and 94.04% accuracy in identifying ‚Äúunknown‚Äù attacks while the false positive rate is 1.8%. To avoid drawing research results and conclusions solely based on experiments with the \{KDD\} dataset, we have also built a dataset (TD-Sim) that consists of a mixture of live trace data from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and simulated traffic based on our testbed network, ensuring adequate coverage of a variety of attacks. Performance evaluation with the TD-Sim dataset shows that A-GHSOM adapts to live traffic and achieves an overall accuracy rate of 97.12% while maintaining the false positive rate of 2.6%. },

  abstract = {Abstract Visualization and interaction of multidimensional data are challenges in visual data analytics, which requires optimized solutions to integrate the display, exploration and analytical reasoning of data into one visual pipeline for human-centered data analysis and interpretation. Even though it is considered to be one of the most popular techniques for visualization and analysis of multidimensional data, parallel coordinate visualization is also suffered from the visual clutter problem as well as the computational complexity problem, same as other visualization methods in which visual clutter occurs where the volume of data needs to be visualized to be increasing. One straightforward way to address these problems is to change the ordering of axis to reach the minimal number of visual clutters. However, the optimization of the ordering of axes is actually a NP-complete problem. In this paper, two axes re-ordering methods are proposed in parallel coordinates visualization: (1) a contribution-based method and (2) a similarity-based method. The contribution-based re-ordering method is mainly based on the singular value decomposition (SVD) algorithm. It can not only provide users with the mathmetical theory for the selection of the first remarkable axis, but also help with visualizing detailed structure of the data according to the contribution of each data dimension. This approach reduces the computational complexity greatly in comparison with other re-ordering methods. A similarity-based re-ordering method is based on the combination of nonlinear correlation coefficient (NCC) and \{SVD\} algorithms. By using this approach, axes are re-ordered in line with the degree of similarities among them. It is much more rational, exact and systemic than other re-ordering methods, including those based on Pearson‚Äôs correlation coefficient (PCC). Meanwhile, the paper also proposes a measurement of contribution rate of each dimension to reveal the property hidden in the dataset. At last, the rationale and effectiveness of these approaches are demonstrated through case studies. For example, the patterns of Smurf and Neptune attacks hidden in \{KDD\} 1999 dataset are visualized in parallel coordinates using contribution-based re-ordering method; \{NCC\} re-ordering method can enlarge the mean crossing angles and reduce the amount of polylines between the neighboring axes. },

  abstract = {Abstract Feature selection is an important and active issue in clustering and classification problems. By choosing an adequate feature subset, a dataset dimensionality reduction is allowed, thus contributing to decreasing the classification computational complexity, and to improving the classifier performance by avoiding redundant or irrelevant features. Although feature selection can be formally defined as an optimisation problem with only one objective, that is, the classification accuracy obtained by using the selected feature subset, in recent years, some multi-objective approaches to this problem have been proposed. These either select features that not only improve the classification accuracy, but also the generalisation capability in case of supervised classifiers, or counterbalance the bias toward lower or higher numbers of features that present some methods used to validate the clustering/classification in case of unsupervised classifiers. The main contribution of this paper is a multi-objective approach for feature selection and its application to an unsupervised clustering procedure based on Growing Hierarchical Self-Organising Maps (GHSOMs) that includes a new method for unit labelling and efficient determination of the winning unit. In the network anomaly detection problem here considered, this multi-objective approach makes it possible not only to differentiate between normal and anomalous traffic but also among different anomalies. The efficiency of our proposals has been evaluated by using the well-known DARPA/NSL-KDD datasets that contain extracted features and labelled attacks from around 2 million connections. The selected feature sets computed in our experiments provide detection rates up to 99.8% with normal traffic and up to 99.6% with anomalous traffic, as well as accuracy values up to 99.12%. },

  abstract = {In the real world it is a routine that one must deal with uncertainty when security is concerned. Intrusion detection systems offer a new challenge in handling uncertainty due to imprecise knowledge in classifying the normal or abnormal behaviour patterns. In this paper we have introduced an emerging approach for intrusion detection system using Neutrosophic Logic Classifier which is an extension/combination of the fuzzy logic, intuitionistic logic, paraconsistent logic, and the three-valued logics that use an indeterminate value. It is capable of handling fuzzy, vague, incomplete and inconsistent information under one framework. Using this new approach there is an increase in detection rate and the significant decrease in false alarm rate. The proposed method tripartitions the dataset into normal, abnormal and indeterministic based on the degree of membership of truthness, degree of membership of indeterminacy and degree of membership of falsity. The proposed method was tested up on \{KDD\} Cup 99 dataset. The Neutrosophic Logic Classifier generates the Neutrosophic rules to determine the intrusion in progress. Improvised genetic algorithm is adopted in order to detect the potential rules for performing better classification. This paper exhibits the efficiency of handling uncertainty in Intrusion detection precisely using Neutrosophic Logic Classifier based Intrusion detection System. },

  abstract = {Abstract The aim of an intrusion detection systems (IDS) is to detect various types of malicious network traffic and computer usage, which cannot be detected by a conventional firewall. Many \{IDS\} have been developed based on machine learning techniques. Specifically, advanced detection approaches created by combining or integrating multiple learning techniques have shown better detection performance than general single learning techniques. The feature representation method is an important pattern classifier that facilitates correct classifications, however, there have been very few related studies focusing how to extract more representative features for normal connections and effective detection of attacks. This paper proposes a novel feature representation approach, namely the cluster center and nearest neighbor (CANN) approach. In this approach, two distances are measured and summed, the first one based on the distance between each data sample and its cluster center, and the second distance is between the data and its nearest neighbor in the same cluster. Then, this new and one-dimensional distance based feature is used to represent each data sample for intrusion detection by a k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) classifier. The experimental results based on the KDD-Cup 99 dataset show that the \{CANN\} classifier not only performs better than or similar to k-NN and support vector machines trained and tested by the original feature representation in terms of classification accuracy, detection rates, and false alarms. I also provides high computational efficiency for the time of classifier training and testing (i.e., detection). },

The framework holds potential for self-managing: self-labeling, self-updating and self-adapting. Our framework employs the Affinity Propagation (AP) algorithm to learn a subject‚Äôs behaviors through dynamical clustering of the streaming data. It automatically labels the data and adapts to normal behavior changes while identifies anomalies. Two large real \{HTTP\} traffic streams collected in our institute as well as a set of benchmark KDD‚Äô99 data are used to validate the framework and the method. The test results show that the autonomic model achieves better results in terms of effectiveness and efficiency compared to adaptive Sequential Karhunen‚ÄìLoeve method and static \{AP\} as well as three other static anomaly detection methods, namely, k-NN, \{PCA\} and SVM. },

  abstract = {Abstract Feature selection can improve classification accuracy and decrease the computational complexity of classification. Data features in intrusion detection systems (IDS) always present the problem of imbalanced classification in which some classifications only have a few instances while others have many instances. This imbalance can obviously limit classification efficiency, but few efforts have been made to address it. In this paper, a scheme for the many-objective problem is proposed for feature selection in IDS, which uses two strategies, namely, a special domination method and a predefined multiple targeted search, for population evolution. It can differentiate traffic not only between normal and abnormal but also by abnormality type. Based on our scheme, NSGA-III is used to obtain an adequate feature subset with good performance. An improved many-objective optimization algorithm (I-NSGA-III) is further proposed using a novel niche preservation procedure. It consists of a bias-selection process that selects the individual with the fewest selected features and a fit-selection process that selects the individual with the maximum sum weight of its objectives. Experimental results show that I-NSGA-III can alleviate the imbalance problem with higher classification accuracy for classes having fewer instances. Moreover, it can achieve both higher classification accuracy and lower computational complexity. },

  abstract = {Anomaly detection in communication networks provides the basis for the uncovering of novel attacks, misconfigurations and network failures. Resource constraints for data storage, transmission and processing make it beneficial to restrict input data to features that are (a) highly relevant for the detection task and (b) easily derivable from network observations without expensive operations. Removing strong correlated, redundant and irrelevant features also improves the detection quality for many algorithms that are based on learning techniques. In this paper we address the feature selection problem for network traffic based anomaly detection. We propose a multi-stage feature selection method using filters and stepwise regression wrappers. Our analysis is based on 41 widely-adopted traffic features that are presented in several commonly used traffic data sets. With our combined feature selection method we could reduce the original feature vectors from 41 to only 16 features. We tested our results with five fundamentally different classifiers, observing no significant reduction of the detection performance. In order to quantify the practical benefits of our results, we analyzed the costs for generating individual features from standard IP Flow Information Export records, available at many routers. We show that we can eliminate 13 very costly features and thus reducing the computational effort for on-line feature generation from live traffic observations at network nodes.},

  abstract = {In supervised learning it has been shown that a collection of weak classifiers can result in a strong classifier with error rates similar to those of more sophisticated methods. In unsupervised learning, namely in anomaly detection such a paradigm has not yet been demonstrated despite the fact that many methods have been devised as counterparts to supervised binary classifiers. This work partially fills the gap by showing that an ensemble of very weak detectors can lead to a strong anomaly detector with a performance equal to or better than state of the art methods. The simplicity of the proposed ensemble system (to be called Loda) is particularly useful in domains where a large number of samples need to be processed in real-time or in domains where the data stream is subject to concept drift and the detector needs to be updated on-line. Besides being fast and accurate, Loda is also able to operate and update itself on data with missing variables. Loda is thus practical in domains with sensor outages. Moreover, Loda can identify features in which the scrutinized sample deviates from the majority. This capability is useful when the goal is to find out what has caused the anomaly. It should be noted that none of these favorable properties increase Loda's low time and space complexity. We compare Loda to several state of the art anomaly detectors in two settings: batch training and on-line training on data streams. The results on 36 datasets from UCI repository illustrate the strengths of the proposed system, but also provide more insight into the more general questions regarding batch-vs-on-line anomaly detection.},

The estimator is formulated as an inner product with a reproducing kernel Hilbert space embedding and makes no assumption about the type or shape of the underlying data distribution. We show that offline (batch) learning with exposecan be done in linear time and online (incremental) learning takes constant time per instance and model update. Furthermore, exposecan make predictions in constant time, while it requires only constant memory. In addition, we propose different methodologies for concept drift adaptation on evolving data streams. On several real datasets we demonstrate that our approach can compete with state of the art algorithms for anomaly detection while being an order of magnitude faster than most other approaches.},

To address this problem, we formalize a novel real-time interval temporal logic‚Äîreal-time attack signature logic (RASL). Based on such a new logic, we put forward a RASL model checking algorithm. Furthermore, we use RASL formulas to describe attack signatures and employ discrete timed automata to create an audit log. As a result, RASL model checking algorithm can be used to automatically verify whether the automata satisfy the formulas, that is, whether the audit log coincides with the attack signatures. The simulation experiments show that the new approach effectively enhances the detection power of the MC-based intrusion detection methods for a number of telnet attacks, p-trace attacks, and the other sixteen types of attacks. And these experiments indicate that the new algorithm can find several types of real-time attacks, whereas the existing MC-based intrusion detection approaches cannot do that.},

  abstract    = {Intrusion detection is well-known as an essential component to secure the systems in Information and Communication Technology (ICT). Based on the type of analyzing events, two kinds of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) have been proposed: anomaly-based and misuse-based. In this paper, three-layer Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture with categorized features as inputs and attack types as outputs of RNN is proposed as misuse-based IDS. The input features are categorized to basic features, content features, time-based traffic features, and host-based traffic features. The attack types are classified to Denial-of-Service (DoS), Probe, Remote-to-Local (R2L), and User-to-Root (U2R). For this purpose, in this study, we use the 41 features per connection defined by International Knowledge Discovery and Data mining group (KDD). The RNN has an extra output which corresponds to normal class (no attack). The connections between the nodes of two hidden layers of RNN are considered partial. Experimental results show that the proposed model is able to improve classification rate, particularly in R2L attacks. This method also offers better Detection Rate (DR) and Cost Per Example (CPE) when compared to similar related works and also the simulated Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Elman-based intrusion detectors. On the other hand, False Alarm Rate (FAR) of the proposed model is not degraded significantly when compared to some recent machine learning methods.},

In this paper, a reduced-size structure of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), based on the grouping of features, is used for misuse detection.

Due to size reduction in RNN, training speed and convergence are improved.

Thus, a fast IDS is reached which is effective in terms of Detection Rate (DR) and Cost Per Example (CPE).

Each connection in KDD is characterized by 41 features and a label which specifies the status of connection records (normal or a specific attack type). 
These features are used as the inputs of RNN and grouped into four categories: 
 basic features (B-F), 
 content features (C-F),
 time-based traffic features (TT-F), 
 and host-based traffic features (HT-F). 
The RNN has five outputs, one of which indicates normal class (no attack). 
The other four outputs of RNN represent the type of detected attacks:
Denial-of-Service (DoS), Probe, Remote-to-Local (R2L),
and User-to-Root (U2R). 
To reduce the size and computational complexity of RNN-based IDS, the nodes of layersare partially connected based on the mentioned four feature categories.


In this work, 49,402 records from ‚Äò‚Äò10% KDD‚Äô‚Äô data set and 31,104 records from ‚Äò‚ÄòCorrected KDD‚Äô‚Äô data set are used as training and test sets, respectively (Table 3).},

  abstract = {Abstract With the rapid growth and the increasing complexity of network infrastructures and the evolution of attacks, identifying and preventing network abuses is getting more and more strategic to ensure an adequate degree of protection from both external and internal menaces. In this scenario many techniques are emerging for inspecting network traffic and discriminating between anomalous and normal behaviors to detect undesired or suspicious activities. Unfortunately, the concept of normal or abnormal network behavior depends on several factors and its recognition requires the availability of a model aiming at characterizing current behavior, based on a statistical idealization of past events. There are two main challenges when generating the training data needed for effective modeling. First, network traffic is very complex and unpredictable, and second, the model is subject to changes over time, since anomalies are continuously evolving. As attack techniques and patterns change, previously gained information about how to tell them apart from normal traffic may be no longer valid. Thus, a desirable characteristic of an effective model for network anomaly detection is its ability to adapt to change and to generalize its behavior to multiple different network environments. In other words, a self-learning system is needed. This suggests the adoption of machine learning techniques to implement semi-supervised anomaly detection systems where the classifier is trained with ‚Äúnormal‚Äù traffic data only, so that knowledge about anomalous behaviors can be constructed and evolve in a dynamic way. For this purpose we explored the effectiveness of a detection approach based on machine learning, using the Discriminative Restricted Boltzmann Machine to combine the expressive power of generative models with good classification accuracy capabilities to infer part of its knowledge from incomplete training data. },

  abstract = {Abstract The growth of the Internet and, consequently, the number of interconnected computers, has exposed significant amounts of information to intruders and attackers. Firewalls aim to detect violations according to a predefined rule-set and usually block potentially dangerous incoming traffic. However, with the evolution of attack techniques, it is more difficult to distinguish anomalies from normal traffic. Different detection approaches have been proposed, including the use of machine learning techniques based on neural models such as Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs). In this paper, we present a classification approach that hybridizes statistical techniques and \{SOM\} for network anomaly detection. Thus, while Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Fisher Discriminant Ratio (FDR) have been considered for feature selection and noise removal, Probabilistic Self-Organizing Maps (PSOM) aim to model the feature space and enable distinguishing between normal and anomalous connections. The detection capabilities of the proposed system can be modified without retraining the map, but only by modifying the units activation probabilities. This deals with fast implementations of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) necessary to cope with current link bandwidths. },

The \{ICLN\} is an unsupervised clustering algorithm, which applies new rules to the standard competitive learning neural network (SCLN). The network neurons in the \{ICLN\} are trained to represent the center of the data by a new reward-punishment update rule. This new update rule overcomes the instability of the SCLN. The \{SICLN\} is a supervised version of the ICLN. In the SICLN, the new supervised update rule uses the data labels to guide the training process to achieve a better clustering result. The \{SICLN\} can be applied to both labeled and unlabeled data and is highly tolerant to missing or delay labels. Furthermore, the \{SICLN\} is capable to reconstruct itself, thus is completely independent from the initial number of clusters. To assess the proposed algorithms, we have performed experimental comparisons on both research data and real-world data in fraud detection and network intrusion detection. The results demonstrate that both the \{ICLN\} and the \{SICLN\} achieve high performance, and the \{SICLN\} outperforms traditional unsupervised clustering algorithms. },

  abstract = {Development of an efficient real time intrusion detection system (IDS) has been proposed in the paper by integrating Q-learning algorithm and rough set theory (RST). The objective of the work is to achieve maximum classification accuracy while detecting intrusions by classifying NSL-KDD network traffic data either ‚Äònormal‚Äô or ‚Äòanomaly‚Äô. Since \{RST\} processes discrete data only, by applying cut operation attributes in training data are discretized. Using indiscernibility concept of RST, reduced attribute sets, called reducts are obtained and among the reducts a single reduct is chosen which provides highest classification accuracy. However, for the test data the same reduct would not provide highest classification accuracy due to change of discretized attribute values. Therefore, to overcome the problem discretization and feature selection processes are dealt in a comprehensive and systematic way in the paper using machine learning approach. The Q-learning algorithm has been modified to learn optimum cut value for different attributes so that corresponding reduct produces maximum classification accuracy while classifying network traffic data. Since, not all attributes but reduct only take part to detect intrusions, the proposed algorithm is faster than Q-learning and reduces complexity of the IDS. Classification accuracy with 98% success rate has been obtained using real time data, which demonstrates superior performance compared to other classifiers. },

  abstract = {Most existing work on classification of data streams assumes that all streaming data are labeled and the class labels are immediately available. However, in real-world applications, such as credit fraud and intrusion detection, this assumption is not always valid. Thus, it is a challenge to learn from concept drifting data streams with unlabeled data. With this motivation, we propose a Semi-supervised classification algorithm for data streams with concept drifts and \{UNlabeled\} data (SUN) in this paper. In SUN, a clustering algorithm is developed from k-Modes and implemented to produce concept clusters at leaves in an incremental decision tree. In terms of deviations between history concept clusters and new ones, potential concept drifts are distinguished from noise. Extensive studies on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that \{SUN\} performs well compared to several state-of-the-art online supervised and semi-supervised algorithms, even when there are more than 90% unlabeled data. A conclusion is hence drawn that \{SUN\} provides a promising framework for tackling concept drifting data streams with unlabeled data. },

  abstract = {Abstract To exploit the strengths of misuse detection and anomaly detection, an intensive focus on intrusion detection combines the two. From a novel perspective, in this paper, we proposed a hybrid approach toward achieving a high detection rate with a low false positive rate. The approach is a two-level hybrid solution consisting of two anomaly detection components and a misuse detection component. In stage 1, an anomaly detection method with low computing complexity is developed and employed to build the detection component. The k-nearest neighbors algorithm becomes crucial in building the two detection components for stage 2. In this hybrid approach, all of the detection components are well-coordinated. The detection component of stage 1 becomes involved in the course of building the two detection components of stage 2 that reduce the false positives and false negatives generated by the detection component of stage 1. Experimental results on the KDD'99 dataset and the Kyoto University Benchmark dataset confirm that the proposed hybrid approach can effectively detect network anomalies with a low false positive rate. },

  abstract = {Abstract Many organizations recognize the necessities of utilizing sophisticated tools and systems to protect their computer networks and reduce the risk of compromising their information. Although many machine-learning-based data classification algorithm has been proposed in network intrusion detection problem, each of them has its own strengths and weaknesses. In this paper, we propose an effective intrusion detection framework by using a new adaptive, robust, precise optimization method, namely, time-varying chaos particle swarm optimization (TVCPSO) to simultaneously do parameter setting and feature selection for multiple criteria linear programming (MCLP) and support vector machine (SVM). In the proposed methods, a weighted objective function is provided, which takes into account trade-off between the maximizing the detection rate and minimizing the false alarm rate, along with considering the number of features. Furthermore, to make the particle swarm optimization algorithm faster in searching the optimum and avoid the search being trapped in local optimum, chaotic concept is adopted in \{PSO\} and time varying inertia weight and time varying acceleration coefficient is introduced. The performance of proposed methods has been evaluated by conducting experiments with the NSL-KDD dataset, which is derived and modified from well-known \{KDD\} cup 99 data sets. The empirical results show that the proposed method performs better in terms of having a high detection rate and a low false alarm rate when compared with the obtained results using all features. },

  abstract = {Intrusion detection is a necessary step to identify unusual access or attacks to secure internal networks. In general, intrusion detection can be approached by machine learning techniques. In literature, advanced techniques by hybrid learning or ensemble methods have been considered, and related work has shown that they are superior to the models using single machine learning techniques. This paper proposes a hybrid learning model based on the triangle area based nearest neighbors (TANN) in order to detect attacks more effectively. In TANN, the k-means clustering is firstly used to obtain cluster centers corresponding to the attack classes, respectively. Then, the triangle area by two cluster centers with one data from the given dataset is calculated and formed a new feature signature of the data. Finally, the k-NN classifier is used to classify similar attacks based on the new feature represented by triangle areas. By using KDD-Cup ‚Äô99 as the simulation dataset, the experimental results show that \{TANN\} can effectively detect intrusion attacks and provide higher accuracy and detection rates, and the lower false alarm rate than three baseline models based on support vector machines, k-NN, and the hybrid centroid-based classification model by combining k-means and k-NN. },

  abstract = {Today data acquisition technologies come up with large datasets with millions of samples for statistical analysis. This creates a tremendous challenge for pattern recognition techniques, which need to be more efficient without losing their effectiveness. We have tried to circumvent the problem by reducing it into the fast computation of an optimum-path forest (OPF) in a graph derived from the training samples. In this forest, each class may be represented by multiple trees rooted at some representative samples. The forest is a classifier that assigns to a new sample the label of its most strongly connected root. The methodology has been successfully used with different graph topologies and learning techniques. In this work, we have focused on one of the supervised approaches, which has offered considerable advantages over Support Vector Machines and Artificial Neural Networks to handle large datasets. We propose (i) a new algorithm that speeds up classification and (ii) a solution to reduce the training set size with negligible effects on the accuracy of classification, therefore further increasing its efficiency. Experimental results show the improvements with respect to our previous approach and advantages over other existing methods, which make the new method a valuable contribution for large dataset analysis. },

To avoid the exponential computation in exhaustive methods, many heuristic feature selection algorithms have been proposed in rough sets. However, these algorithms still suffer from high computational cost. In this paper, we propose a novel heuristic feature selection algorithm (called FSMRDE) in rough sets. To measure the significance of features in FSMRDE, we propose a new model of relative decision entropy, which is an extension of Shannon◊≥s information entropy in rough sets. Moreover, to test the effectiveness of FSMRDE, we apply it to intrusion detection and other application domains. Experimental results show that by using the relative decision entropy-based feature significance as heuristic information, \{FSMRDE\} is efficient for feature selection. In particular, \{FSMRDE\} is able to achieve good scalability for large data sets. },

This algorithm consists of a number of steps including density-based outlier removal, new cluster generation, and cluster update. It is designed for applications when data samples are received in an online manner in frames. Such frames are first passed through an outlier removal step to generate denoised frames with consistent data samples during transitions times between clusters. A classification step is then applied to find whether frames belong to any of existing clusters. When frames do not get matched to any of existing clusters and certain criteria are met, a new cluster is created in real time and in an on-the-fly manner by using support vector domain descriptors. Experiments involving four synthetic and two real datasets are conducted to show the performance of the introduced clustering algorithm in terms of cluster purity and normalized mutual information. Comparison results with similar clustering algorithms designed for streaming data are also reported exhibiting the effectiveness of the introduced online frame-based clustering algorithm. },

This paper presents a novel approach for intrusion detection using a modified \{OPF\} (MOPF) algorithm for improving the performance of traditional \{OPF\} in terms of detection rate (DR), false alarm rate (FAR), and time of execution. To address the problem of scalability in large datasets and also for achieving high attack recognition rates, the proposed framework employs the k-means clustering algorithm, as a partitioning module, for generating different homogeneous training subsets from original heterogeneous training samples. In the proposed \{MOPF\} algorithm, the distance between unlabeled samples and the root (prototype) of every sample in \{OPF\} is also considered in classifying unlabeled samples with the aim of improving the accuracy rate of traditional \{OPF\} algorithm. Moreover, the centrality and the prestige concepts in the social network analysis are employed in a pruning module for determining the most informative samples in training subsets to speed up the traditional \{OPF\} algorithm. The experimental results on NSL-KDD dataset show that the proposed method performs better than traditional \{OPF\} in terms of accuracy rate, DR, FAR, and cost per example (CPE) evaluation metrics. },

Conventional adaptive intrusion detection systems are computationally expensive in terms of computer resources and time because these systems have to be retrained with known and unknown attacks. In this study, a method called Real-Time Multi-agent System for an Adaptive Intrusion Detection System RTMAS-AIDS, which is based on a multi-agent system, is proposed to allow the intrusion detection system to adapt to unknown attacks in real-time. This method utilizes the classification models multi-level hybrid \{SVM\} and \{ELM\} to detect normal behavior and known attacks. An adaptive \{SVM\} model, in which processes run in parallel and are distributed in MAS, is also used to detect and learn new attacks in real-time. Results show that the proposed method significantly reduced the training cost of detecting unknown attacks compared with the conventional method. In addition, the analysis results of the popular KDDCup‚Äô99 dataset show that RTMAS-AIDS can detect Probe, R2L, and \{U2R\} attacks better than the non-retrained multi-agent system using the multi-level hybrid \{SVM\} and \{ELM\} models as well as the multi-level hybrid \{SVM\} and ELM. RTMAS-AIDS exhibited a significantly improved detection accuracy that reached 95.86% and can detect and learn unknown attacks faster (up to 61%) than the other two methods (MAS-MLSE and MLSE). },

The elitist archive and elitist crossover were combined with the artificial immune algorithm (AIA) to produce the AIAE-GRNN algorithm, with the aim of improving its adaptivity and accuracy. In this paper, the mean square errors (MSEs) were considered the affinity function. The AIAE was used to optimize the smooth factors of the GRNN; then, the optimal smooth factor was solved and substituted into the trained GRNN. Thus, the intrusive data were classified. The paper selected a GRNN that was separately optimized using a genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and fuzzy C-mean clustering (FCM) to enable a comparison of these approaches. As shown in the results, the AIAE-GRNN achieves a higher classification accuracy than PSO-GRNN, but the running time of AIAE-GRNN is long, which was proved first. FCM and GA-GRNN were eliminated because of their deficiencies in terms of accuracy and convergence. To improve the running speed, the paper adopted principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensions of the intrusive data. With the reduction in dimensionality, the PCA-AIAE-GRNN decreases in accuracy less and has better convergence than the PCA-PSO-GRNN, and the running speed of the PCA-AIAE-GRNN was relatively improved. The experimental results show that the AIAE-GRNN has a higher robustness and accuracy than the other algorithms considered and can thus be used to classify the intrusive data.</p>},

Three basic stages of the classifier construction---feature selection, generation of fuzzy rule base, and optimization of the parameters of rule antecedents---are identified. At the first stage, several feature subsets on the basis of discrete harmonic search are generated by using the wrapper scheme. The classifier structure is formed by the rule base generation algorithm by using extreme feature values. The optimal parameters of the fuzzy classifier are extracted from the training data using continuous harmonic search. Akaike information criterion is deployed to identify the best performing classifiers. The performance of the classifier was tested on real-world KEEL and KDD Cup 1999 datasets. The proposed algorithms were compared with other fuzzy classifiers tested on the same datasets. Experimental results show efficiency of the proposed approach and demonstrate that highly accurate classifiers can be constructed by using relatively few features.},

  abstract  = {The demand for better intrusion detection systems, especially anomaly intrusion detection, increases daily, as new attacks arise and Internet speeds increase. The criterion for a good intrusion detection system is to detect emerging attacks with high accuracy at line rates. Existing systems suffer from high false positives and negatives, and are unable to handle increasing traffic rates. This paper applies artificial bee colony for anomaly-based intrusion detection systems. In addition, it uses two feature selection techniques to reduce the amount of data used for detection and classification. KDD Cup 99 dataset was used to evaluate the proposed algorithm. Experimental results show that artificial bee colony achieves average accuracy rate of 97.5% for known attacks and 93.2% overall for known and unknown attacks. The new algorithm outperforms all methods reported in the literature. Copyright ¬© 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Intrusion detection has become an indispensable technique to ensure the security and reliability of information systems. Support vector machine (SVM) and its many improved algorithms have been successfully applied to intrusion detection systems in recent years. However, the training process of SVM ignores an important prior knowledge, the within-class structure in the training set. In this paper, we propose an improved classification algorithm, which combines minimum within-class scatter in Fisher discriminant analysis with traditional SVM. The central idea is to find an optimal separating hyperplane such that the margin is maximized, whereas the within-class scatter is kept as small as possible. This new algorithm is called SVM with minimum within-class scatter (WCS-SVM). A set of experiments is conducted on ten benchmarking datasets and KDDCUP'99 experimental data of MIT Lincoln Laboratory to test the generalization performance of the WCS-SVM algorithm. Experimental results show that the WCS-SVM algorithm has better discriminatory power than traditional SVM and kernel Fisher discriminant analysis and it has higher true detection rate and lower false positive rate for intrusion detection systems.

  abstract = {One of the main problems of existing approaches in anomaly detection in intrusion detection system (IDS) is that IDSs provide only binary detection result: intrusion (attack) or normal. If some attack data or normal data is belonged to boundary, they may be classified wrongly. That is a main cause of high false rates and inaccurate detection rates in IDS. We propose a new approach named Quantitative Intrusion Intensity Assessment (QIIA) that exploits proximity metrics computation so that it provides intrusion (or normal) quantitative intensity value. It is capable of representing how an instance of audit data is proximal to intrusion or normal in a numerical value. This can identify unknown intrusion and normal pattern more accurately. Prior to applying QIIA to audit data, we perform feature selection and parameter optimization of detection models to decrease the overheads to process audit data and to enhance detection rates. Random Forests is used to generate proximity metrics that represent the intrusion intensity (and normal instance intensity) in a numerical way. The numerical value is used to determine whether unknown audit data are intrusion or normal. We carry out several experiments on KDD 1999 dataset and the experimental results show the feasibility of our approach. Copyright ¬© 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract  = {Feature selection methods play a significant role during classification of data having high dimensions of features. The methods select most relevant subset of features that describe data appropriately. Mutual information (MI) based upon information theory is one of the metrics used for measuring relevance of features. This paper analyses various feature selection methods for (1) reduction in number of features; (2) performance of Na√Øve Bayes classification model trained on reduced set of features. Research gaps identified are: (1) computation of MI from the whole sample space instead of unclassified sample subspace; (2) consideration of relevance of features only or tradeoff between relevance and redundancy, but class conditional interaction of features is ignored.In this paper, we propose a general evaluation function using MI for feature selection. The proposed evaluation function is implemented which use dynamically computed MI values from unclassified instances. Effectiveness of the proposed feature selection method is done empirically by comparing classification results using KDD 1999 benchmarked dataset of intrusion detection. The results indicate practicability and effectiveness of the proposed method for applications concerned with high accuracy and stability of predictions. Copyright ¬© 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract  = {Network security risks grow with increase in the network size. In recent past, the attacks on computer networks have increased tremendously and require efficient network intrusion detection mechanisms. Data mining and machine-learning techniques have been used for network intrusion detection during the past few years and have gained much popularity. In this paper, we propose an intrusion detection mechanism based on binary particle swarm optimization (PSO) and random forests (RF) algorithms called PSO-RF and investigate the performance of various dimension reduction techniques along with a set of different classifiers including the proposed approach. Binary PSO is used to find more appropriate set of attributes for classifying network intrusions, and RF is used as a classifier. In the preprocessing step, we reduce the dimensions of the dataset by using different state-of-the-art dimension reduction techniques, and then this reduced dataset is presented to the proposed PSO-RF approach that further optimizes the dimensions of the data and finds an optimal set of features. PSO is an optimization method that has a strong global search capability and is used here for dimension optimization. We perform extensive experimentation to prove the worth of the proposed approach by using different performance metrics. The standard benchmark, that is, KDD99Cup dataset, is used that contains the information about various kinds of network intrusions. The experimental results indicate that the proposed approach performs better than the other approaches for the detection of all kinds of attacks present in the dataset.

  abstract  = {Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) mainly focus on the original features extracted from the communications networks without complex pre-processing. In this paper, we propose new methods for class-dependent feature transformation to improve the accuracy of the IDS. In the previously known class-dependent feature transformation methods, the mapping process is accomplished by employing separate mapping matrices for each class of the dataset. In the training phase, samples of each class is mapped using only the corresponding matrix, whereas, in the test phase, each sample is mapped using all transformation matrices. This may lead to inaccuracy in classification. We modify the training and test phases of the class-dependent methods to extract more information from the dataset in the training phase that the other class-dependent methods ignore. Unlike the previously known class-dependent methods, the training and test phases of our proposed methods are very similar. We evaluate the performance of the proposed methods by measuring Mutual Information, and Maximum-Relevancy Minimum-Redundancy Information on a benchmark dataset for intrusion detection, namely NSL-KDD dataset, and on three different types of classifiers: distance-based, neural network-based, and decision tree-based classifiers. The experimental results demonstrate that the classifiers trained on the dataset transformed by our proposed feature transformation methods are more accurate in detecting intruders. In all experiments, the proposed methods perform better than their peers in increasing the classifier accuracy and reducing the false alarm of the detection process.

We also use ensemble design using AdaBoost to enhance the detection rate of the proposed hybrid system. Further, to have a better overall detection, we propose to combine farthest first traversal (FFT) clustering with classification techniques to obtain another two hybrid methods such as DTFF (DT‚Äâ+‚ÄâFFT) and FFNN (NNge‚Äâ+‚ÄâFFT). Finally, we use Bayesian belief network with Tabu search combined with NNge for better detection rate. Because most of the anomaly detection uses binary labels, that is, anomaly or normal, without discussing more details about the attack types, we perform two-class classification for our proposed methodologies in this paper. Substantial experiments are conducted using NSL-KDD dataset, which is a modified version of KDD99 intrusion dataset. Finally, empirical results with a detailed analysis for all the approaches show that hybrid classification with clustering DTFF provides the best anomaly detection rate among all others.

  abstract = {The feature selection phase in network attack detection is mostly classifier based, while clustering techniques are used for labeling and creating compact training datasets. Because clustering finds natural groupings in the data, in this paper, a clustering-based layered wrapper feature selection approach, LAWRA, has been proposed for selecting appropriate features for attack detection. The existing layered feature selection approaches in attack detection are unable to give results with high precision and recall because of the dependence on classifier accuracy, fitness value, and so on. Hence, in this paper, LAWRA uses external cluster validity indices, F-measure, and Fowlkes‚ÄìMallows index, for feature selection. The two indices are the harmonic and geometric mean of precision and recall, respectively. Each index identifies features that give high precision and high recall of the attack detection algorithm. The first layer of LAWRA identifies the feature subset that best distinguishes between normal and attack instances and the second layer identifies the best cooperating features using cooperative game theory. Experiments have been conducted on NSL-KDD dataset, and LAWRA has been compared with the existing approaches using different classifiers. The results show that LAWRA gives better overall accuracy and F-measure value than the other approaches. Copyright ¬© 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

In this work, we propose a three-stage method to detect outliers. First, alerts are clustered using the k-means algorithm; then, the generated set of meta-alerts is filtered based on distances between the centroids of the different clusters. Finally, outliers are identified from the filtered meta-alerts using a binary optimization algorithm. Our method is evaluated using the University of California-Irvine machine learning repository and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency data sets. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms concurrent methods for outlier detection. Copyright ¬© 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Anomaly detection as a kind of intrusion detection is good at detecting the unknown attacks or new attacks, and it has attracted much attention during recent years. In this paper, a new hierarchy anomaly intrusion detection model that combines the fuzzy c-means (FCM) based on genetic algorithm and SVM is proposed. During the process of detecting intrusion, the membership function and the fuzzy interval are applied to it, and the process is extended to soft classification from the previous hard classification. Then a fuzzy error correction sub interval is introduced, so when the detection result of a data instance belongs to this range, the data will be re-detected in order to improve the effectiveness of intrusion detection. Experimental results show that the proposed model can effectively detect the vast majority of network attack types, which provides a feasible solution for solving the problems of false alarm rate and detection rate in anomaly intrusion detection model.

  abstract = {The development of intrusion detection systems (IDS) that are adapted to allow routers and network defence systems to detect malicious network traffic disguised as network protocols or normal access is a critical challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach called SCDNN, which combines spectral clustering (SC) and deep neural network (DNN) algorithms. First, the dataset is divided into k subsets based on sample similarity using cluster centres, as in SC. Next, the distance between data points in a testing set and the training set is measured based on similarity features and is fed into the deep neural network algorithm for intrusion detection. Six KDD-Cup99 and NSL-KDD datasets and a sensor network dataset were employed to test the performance of the model. These experimental results indicate that the SCDNN classifier not only performs better than backpropagation neural network (BPNN), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF) and Bayes tree models in detection accuracy and the types of abnormal attacks found. It also provides an effective tool of study and analysis of intrusion detection in large networks.},

As the speed of the network increases, so will the attacking methods on future generation communication network. To correspond to these wide variety of attacks, intrusion detection systems and intrusion prevention systems also need a wide variety of counter measures. As a result, an effective method to compare and analyze network data is needed. These methods are needed because when a method to compare and analyze network data is effective, the verification of intrusion detection systems and intrusion prevention systems can be trusted. In this paper, we use extractable standard protocol information of network data to compare and analyze the data of \{MIT\} Lincoln Lab with the data of \{KDD\} \{CUP\} 99 (modeled from Lincoln Lab). Correspondence Analysis and statistical analyzing method is used for comparing data. },

To cope with the new era of big data, new approaches need to be explored to address this problem effectively. In this paper, we review recent work related to attribute subset selection in decision-theoretic rough set models. We also introduce a scalable implementation of a parallel genetic algorithm in Hadoop MapReduce to approximate the minimum reduct which has the same discernibility power as the original attribute set in the decision table. Then, we focus on intrusion detection in computer networks and apply the proposed approach on four datasets with varying characteristics. The results show that the proposed model can be a powerful tool to boost the performance of identifying attributes in the minimum reduct in large-scale decision systems. },

A number of intrusion detection methods have been developed for protecting computers and networks using conventional statistical methods as well as data mining methods. Data mining methods for misuse and anomaly-based intrusion detection, usually encompass supervised, unsupervised and outlier methods. It is necessary that the capabilities of intrusion detection methods be updated with the creation of new attacks. This paper proposes a multi-level hybrid intrusion detection method that uses a combination of supervised, unsupervised and outlier-based methods for improving the efficiency of detection of new and old attacks. The method is evaluated with a captured real-time flow and packet dataset called the Tezpur University intrusion detection system (TUIDS) dataset, a distributed denial of service dataset, and the benchmark intrusion dataset called the knowledge discovery and data mining Cup 1999 dataset and the new version of KDD (NSL-KDD) dataset. Experimental results are compared with existing multi-level intrusion detection methods and other classifiers. The performance of our method is very good.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the number of people using the Internet and network services is increasing day by day. On a daily basis, a large amount of data is generated over the Internet from zeta byte to petabytes with a very high speed. On the other hand, we see more security threats on the network, the Internet, websites, and the enterprise network. Therefore, detecting intrusion in such ultra-high-speed environment in real time is a challenging task. Many intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are proposed for various types of network attacks using machine learning approaches. Most of them are unable to detect recent unknown attacks, whereas the others do not provide a real-time solution to overcome the above-mentioned challenges. Therefore, to address these problems, we propose a real-time intrusion detection system for ultra-high-speed big data environment using Hadoop implementation. The proposed system includes four-layered IDS architecture, which consists of the capturing layer, filtration and load balancing layer, processing or Hadoop layer, and the decision-making layer. Furthermore, feature selection scheme is proposed that selects nine parameters for classification using (FSR) and (BER), as well as from the analysis of DARPA datasets. In addition, five major machine learning approaches are used to evaluate the proposed system including J48, REPTree, random forest tree, conjunctive rule, support vector machine, and Na{\"i}ve Bayes classifiers. Results show that among all these classifiers, REPTree and J48 are the best classifiers in terms of accuracy as well as efficiency. The proposed system architecture is evaluated with respect to accuracy in terms of true positive (TP) and false positive (FP), with respect to efficiency in terms of processing time and by comparing results with traditional techniques. It has more than 99¬†{\%} TP and less than 0.001¬†{\%} FP on REPTree and J48. The system has overall higher accuracy than existing IDSs with the capability to work in real time in ultra-high-speed big data environment.},

  abstract = {Intrusion detection system (IDS) is one of the important elements for providing the security in networks. Increasing the number of network-based applications on the one hand and increasing the data volumes on the other hand forced the designers to conduct some research on the novel methods for improving network security. One of the recent efforts to improve IDS performance is developing the machine learning algorithms. Random forest is one of the powerful algorithms employed in data mining. It operates based on classifier fusion principles and is implemented as detection engine in some anomaly-based IDSs. In this paper, we present a novel parallel random forest algorithm for intrusion detection systems. The original random forest algorithm has some weaknesses in feature selection, selecting efficient numbers of classifiers, number of random features for training and also in combination steps. In this research we investigate aforementioned challenges and propose solutions for them. The simulation results show the superiority of our method regarding performance,¬†scalability and¬†cost of misclassified samples in our method in comparison with the original random forest algorithm and Hadoop-based version of the random forest.},

Due to unlimited and difficult storage features, the routine classification algorithm (eg.

In this paper, we propose an improved Hoeffding tree data-stream classification algorithm, Hoeffding-ID and apply it to the network data-stream process of the intrusion detection field. Experimental results shows that the Hoeffding-ID algorithm has relative high detection accuracy, low positives rate and memory usage not increasing with the data samples.},

Normal Review in Review Article.

As the number of connection records in training and test data set is very large, so it is practically very difficult to use the whole data set. Thus, in order to conduct unbiased learning and testing of the proposed approach, we used subsets of the dataset containing different proportions of normal and attack instances.
