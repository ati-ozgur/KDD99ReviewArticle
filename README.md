# KDD99 Review Article

bibliography file, python scripts and latex source files for reproducibility

## Note 

I have written a review article for KDD99 named A review of KDD99 dataset usage in intrusion detection and machine learning between 2010 and 2015.
This older article were published as [https://peerj.com/preprints/1954/](preprint)
These source files are for new version of that article.
Using python scripts and bibliography file, tables and figures in new article submission can be reproduced.
